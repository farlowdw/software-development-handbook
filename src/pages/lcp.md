# LeetCode Problems (LCP)

The following problems deserve to be revisited at some point.

- <LC id='15' type='long' ></LC>: Apparently this is a classic problem interviewers like to ask, in part because of the variation in approaches and follow ups. A two pointers approach (after pre-sorting) is the standard strategy, but other possibilities exist, namely the use of a hash table as well as a "no-sort" solution. Other problems to follow up on might be <LC id='259' type='long' ></LC> or <LC id='16' type='long' ></LC>.
- <LC id='344' type='long' ></LC>: The two pointer approach is clear here, but a recursive approach might be worth exploring.
- <LC id='392' type='long' ></LC>: The two pointer approach is quite clear here, but other (less obvious and more complicated) approaches include the following: divide and conquer with greedy, greedy match with character indices hashmap, and dynamic programming.
- <LC id='986' type='long' ></LC>: The two pointer approach is quite nifty for this interval problem.
