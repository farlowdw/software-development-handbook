### Cheatsheets

| Resource | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| [Devhints](https://devhints.io/) | This resource has numerous high-quality cheatsheets for various things developers are likely to use (e.g., [bash](https://devhints.io/bash), [fish-shell](https://devhints.io/fish-shell), [ffmpeg](https://devhints.io/ffmpeg), [homebrew](https://devhints.io/homebrew), [vim](https://devhints.io/vim), etc.). There's also a search interface on the homepage to make it easier to find possible cheatsheet resources for your desired tool. |
| [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) | The tldr-pages project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional man pages. For example, `tldr tar` won't be a billion pages but a quick reference of commands that are likely to be quite helpful. |
| [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat) | This project makes it possible to create and view cheatsheets on the command-line. Cheatsheets can be either those by the community (ones that come by default upon package installation) or those you make for yourself. Being able to make your own personal cheatsheets makes this an awesome resource. |
| [Big O Cheatsheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) | Well-known resource that discusses big-O in terms of time- and space-complexities for various data structures and algorithms. |

### Colors

| Resource | Description |

| [Canva color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) | Pick a color, then specify a color combination, and then use the color combination provided. I've used this before to find nice complementary colors. |
| [Color](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/color/) | Colors available via Material-UI |
