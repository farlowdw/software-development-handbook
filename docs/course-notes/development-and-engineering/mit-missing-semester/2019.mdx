## 3 - Shell scripting

### Exercises

#### 3.1 (bash and Linux)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.1-q' label='Question'>

If you are completely new to the shell you may want to read a more comprehensive guide about it such as [BashGuide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide). If you want a more in-depth introduction [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) is a good resource.

#### 3.2 (`PATH`, `which`, `type`)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.2-q' label='Question'>

We briefly discussed that the `PATH` environment variable is used to locate the programs that you run through the command line. Let's explore that a little further

- Run echo `$PATH` (or `echo $PATH | tr -s ':' '\n`' for pretty printing) and examine its contents. What locations are listed?
- The command `which` locates a program in the user `PATH`. Try running `which` for common commands like `echo`, `ls`, or `mv`. Note that `which` is a bit limited since it does not understand shell aliases. Try running `type` and `command -v` for those same commands. How is the output different?
- Run `PATH=` and try running the previous commands again, some work and some don't, can you figure out why?

#### 3.3 (special variables)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.3-q' label='Question'>

- What does the variable `~` expands as? What about `.`? And `..`?
- What does the variable `$?` do?
- What does the variable `$_` do?
- What does the variable `!!` expand to? What about `!!*`? And `!l`?
- Look for documentation for these options and familiarize yourself with them

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='3.3-a' label='Answer'>

answer

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='3.3-ad' label='Additional Details'>

None

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3.4

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.4-q' label='Question'>

Sometimes piping doesn't quite work because the command being piped into does not expect the newline separated format. For example `file` command tells you properties of the file.

Try running `ls | file` and `ls | xargs file`. What is `xargs` doing?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='3.4-a' label='Answer'>

<TabItem value='3.4-ad' label='Additional Details'>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3.5

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.5-q' label='Question'>

When you write a script you can specify to your shell what interpreter should be used to interpret the script by using a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line. Write a script called `hello` with the following contents and make it executable with `chmod +x hello`. Then execute it with `./hello`. Then remove the first line and execute it again? How is the shell using that first line?

```bash
#! /usr/bin/python

print("Hello World!")
```

You will often see programs that have a shebang that looks like #! usr/bin/env bash. This is a more portable solution with it own set of [advantages and disadvantages](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29608/why-is-it-better-to-use-usr-bin-env-name-instead-of-path-to-name-as-my). How is `env` different from `which`? What environment variable does `env` use to decide what program to run?

#### 3.6 (pipes, process substitution, subshell)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.6-q' label='Question'>

Create a script called `slow_seq.sh` with the following contents and do `chmod +x slow_seq.sh` to make it executable.

``` BASH
#! /usr/bin/env bash

for i in $(seq 1 10); do
  echo $i;
  sleep 1;
done
```

There is a way in which pipes (and process substitution) differ from using subshell execution, i.e. `$()`. Run the following commands and observe the differences:

- `./slow_seq.sh | grep -P "[3-6]"`
- `grep -P "[3-6]" <(./slow_seq.sh)`
- `echo $(./slow_seq.sh) | grep -P "[3-6]"`

#### 3.7 (misc)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.7-q' label='Question'>

- Try running `touch {a,b}{a,b}` then `ls` what did appear?
- Sometimes you want to keep `stdin` and still pipe it to a file. Try running `echo HELLO | tee hello.txt`
- Try running `cat hello.txt > hello.txt` what do you expect to happen? What does happen?
- Run `echo HELLO > hello.txt` and then run `echo WORLD >> hello.txt`. What are the contents of `hello.txt`? How is `>` different from `>>`?
- Run `printf "\e[38;5;81mfoo\e[0m\n"`. How was the output different? If you want to know more, search for ANSI color escape sequences.
- Run `touch a.txt` then run `^txt^log` what did bash do for you? In the same vein, run `fc`. What does it do?

#### 3.8 (keyboard shortcuts)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='3.8-q' label='Question'>

As with any application you use frequently is worth familiarising yourself with its keyboard shortcuts. Type the following ones and try figuring out what they do and in what scenarios it might be convenient knowing about them. For some of them it might be easier searching online about what they do. (remember that `^X` means pressing `Ctrl+X`)

- `^A`, `^E`
- `^R`
- `^L`
- `^C`, `^\` and `^D`
- `^U` and `^Y`

## 7 - Version control (Git)

### Exercises

#### 7.1

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='7.1-q' label='Question'>

On a repo try modifying an existing file. What happens when you do `git stash`? What do you see when running `git log --all --oneline`? Run `git stash pop` to undo what you did with `git stash`. In what scenario might this be useful?

#### 7.2

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='7.2-q' label='Question'>

One common mistake when learning git is to commit large files that should not be managed by git or adding sensitive information. Try adding a file to a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history (you may want to look at [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)). Also if you do want git to manage large files for you, look into [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

#### 7.3

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='7.3-q' label='Question'>

Git is really convenient for undoing changes but one has to be familiar even with the most unlikely changes

1. If a file is mistakenly modified in some commit it can be reverted with `git revert`. However if a commit involves several changes `revert` might not be the best option. How can we use `git checkout` to recover a file version from a specific commit?
2. Create a branch, make a commit in said branch and then delete it. Can you still recover said commit? Try looking into `git reflog`. (Note: Recover dangling things quickly, git will periodically automatically clean up commits that nothing points to.)
3. If one is too trigger happy with `git reset --hard` instead of `git reset` changes can be easily lost. However since the changes were staged, we can recover them. (look into `git fsck --lost-found` and `.git/lost-found`).

<TabItem value='7.4-q' label='Question'>

In any git repo look under the folder `.git/hooks` you will find a bunch of scripts that end with `.sample`. If you rename them without the `.sample` they will run based on their name. For instance `pre-commit` will execute before doing a commit. Experiment with them.

#### 7.5

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='7.5-q' label='Question'>

Like many command line tools `git` provides a configuration file (or dotfile) called `~/.gitconfig` . Create an alias using `~/.gitconfig` so that when you run `git graph` you get the output of `git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph` (this is a good command to quickly visualize the commit graph).

<TabItem value='7.7-q' label='Question'>

Once you start to get more familiar with `git`, you will find yourself running into common tasks, such as editing your `.gitignore`. [git extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Commands.md) provides a bunch of little utilities that integrate with `git`. For example `git ignore PATTERN` will add the specified pattern to the `.gitignore` file in your repo and `git ignore-io LANGUAGE` will fetch the common ignore patterns for that language from [`gitignore.io`](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). Install `git extras` and try using some tools like `git alias` or `git ignore`.

Once you get used to command line applications GUI tools can feel cumbersome/bloated.

One way to efficiently implement deduplication is to use hardlinks. Whereas symbolic link (also called a soft link or a symlink) is a file that points to another file or folder, a hardlink is a exact copy of the pointer (it uses the same inode and points to the same place in the disk). Thus if the original file is removed a symlink stops working whereas a hard link doesn’t. However, hardlinks only work for files. Try using the command ln to create hard links and compare them to symlinks created with `ln -s`. (In macOS you will need to install the gnu coreutils or the `hln` package).

Another use of local port forwarding is to tunnel certain host to the server. If your network filters some website like for example `reddit.com` you can tunnel it through the server as follows:

- Run `ssh remote_server -L 80:reddit.com:80`
- Set `reddit.com` and `www.reddit.com` to `127.0.0.1` in `/etc/hosts`
- Check that you are accessing that website through the server
- If it is not obvious use a website such as [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) which will change depending on your host public ip.
