## Introduction

The grading rubric, outlined below in its most bare form, may be found in <BibRef id='fangprepSubstack' >Specifically, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gy9cmPwNhZvola7kqnfY3DElk7PYrz2ARpaCODTp8Go/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Excel template</a> that includes the most recent version.</BibRef>. An elaboration on each component may be found after the template.
