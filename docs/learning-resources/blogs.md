- [Stack-based graph traversal ≠ depth first search](https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/12/17/stack-based-graph-traversal.html): Goes into detail about how modifying the standard version of the BFS algorithm on generalized graphs by replacing the queue with a stack does *not* result in a true DFS. The [Wiki article on DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search#Pseudocode), specifically the pseudocode section, provides David's comments in a different manner.
