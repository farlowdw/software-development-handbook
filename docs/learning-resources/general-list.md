- [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262140874/): This is an ambitious book attempting to give you a cohesive understanding of how everything in a computer works. Each chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from writing elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the way to an application the size of a Tetris game. See the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) companion site for more. See the [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course) as well. A free [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) is available also.

#### JavaScript

- [Minimal API Surface Area - Sebastian Markbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8): I'll explain how React is moving towards a minimal API surface area. Instead of providing many framework features, React is trying to utilize patterns, paradigms and JavaScript language features to accomplish the same tasks that other frameworks have dedicated APIs for. We start out with higher order runtime features and then backport them to use ES6 language features and syntax. How does the JSX syntax extension fits into this model? I will also touch on the syntax proposals we and other framework authors are making to ES7 and future versions of JavaScript.

#### System design
