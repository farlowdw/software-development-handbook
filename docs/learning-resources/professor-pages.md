```a title="Stumbling Across Amazing Professor Pages (Hidden Gems)"
google search -> so many results
              #highlight-error-start
              -> useless first result
              -> useless second result
              #highlight-error-end
              #highlight-success-start
              -> hm, this result seems promising
              -> notice the useful result is tied to a page by some professor
              -> visit professor's page and notice TONS of other awesome resources
              -> spend countless hours browsing
              -> profit
              #highlight-success-end
```

The process above is something most of us have encountered at some point. For example, recently I was searching about *Abstract Data Types (ADTs)*, and many of the results I didn't find all that useful at first. But then I stumbled across [this random handout](https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs327_s04/chapter2.pdf) that seemed quite nice. Looking at the URL gave me a good idea:

```
https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs327_s04/chapter2.pdf
```

Visiting `https://math.hws.edu/eck` might lead to some other high quality content. [It did.](https://math.hws.edu/eck/) This general idea made me think it might be useful to start tabulating some of the very high quality content I've come across from different web pages dedicated to the work by some seriously awesome professors. Such pages are often gold mines of information. Professors will often list courses they've taught along with the associated coursework and resources they've either recommended or created themselves. 

Below are some different "professor pages" I've come across that I've found to be quite valuable. Maybe you will as well!
