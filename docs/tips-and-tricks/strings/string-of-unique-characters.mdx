## Introduction

A neat trick to count the characters in a string of unique characters is to use a 26-bit bitmask to indicate which lower case Latin characters are inside the string.

```python
mask = 0
for c in word:
  mask |= (1 << (ord(c) - ord('a')))
```

To determine if two strings have common characters, perform `&` on the two bitmasks. If the result is non-zero (i.e., `mask_a & mask_b > 0`) then the two strings have common characters.
