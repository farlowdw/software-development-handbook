## A

### Algorithm {#def-algorithm}

> An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task, namely a well-specified *problem*, where the problem is specified by describing the complete set of *instances* it must work on and of its output after running on one of these instances.

:::caution Problem vs. Problem Instance

The distinction between a problem and an instance of a problem is critical. Determining that you are dealing with a general problem instead of an instance is your first step towards solving it.

:::info Three Desirable Properties for any Algorithm

There are three desirable properties for a good algorithm. We seek algorithms that are

1. correct
2. efficient
3. easy to implement

Correctness may be formally verified by means of a proof (e.g., induction, contradiction, etc.) while efficiency is typically analyzed and established by means of Big-$O$ notation.
