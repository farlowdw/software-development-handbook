The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the **same character**. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251"`:

  <img width="575px" src={require('@site/static/img/lc/38-f1.png').default} />
</p>

Given a positive integer `n`, return the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> term of the **count-and-say** sequence.
