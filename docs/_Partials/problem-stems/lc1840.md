You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building **must** be `0`.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where <code>restrictions[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, maxHeight<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that building <code>id<sub>i</sub></code> must have a height **less than or equal to** <code>maxHeight<sub>i</sub></code>.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in `restrictions`, and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.

Return the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building.
