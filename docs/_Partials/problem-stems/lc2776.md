Write a function that accepts another function `fn` and converts the callback-based function into a promise-based function. 

The `promisify` function takes in a function `fn` that accepts a callback as its first argument and also any additional arguments. It returns a new function that returns a promise instead. The returned promise should resolve with the result of the original function when the callback is called with a successful response, and reject with the error when the callback is called with an error. The returned promise-based function should accept the additional arguments as inputs.

The following is an example of a function that could be passed into `promisify`.

```js
function sum(callback, a, b) {
  if (a < 0 || b < 0) {
    const err = Error('a and b must be positive');
    callback(undefined, err);
  } else {
    callback(a + b);
  }
}
```

This is the equivalent code based on promises:

```js
async function sum(a, b) {
  if (a < 0 || b < 0) {
    throw Error('a and b must be positive');
  } else {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```
