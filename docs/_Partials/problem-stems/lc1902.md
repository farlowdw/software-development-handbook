You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `order` of length `n`, a **permutation** of integers from `1` to `n` representing the **order** of insertion into a **binary search tree**.

A binary search tree is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The binary search tree is constructed as follows:

- `order[0]` will be the **root** of the binary search tree.
- All subsequent elements are inserted as the **child** of **any** existing node such that the binary search tree properties hold.

Return the **depth** of the binary search tree.

A binary tree's **depth** is the number of **nodes** along the **longest path** from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
