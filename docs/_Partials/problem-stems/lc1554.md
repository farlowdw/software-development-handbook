Given a list of strings `dict` where all the strings are of the same length.

Return `True` if there are `2` strings that only differ by `1` character in the same index, otherwise return `False`.

**Follow up:** Could you solve this problem in `O(n*m)` where `n` is the length of dict and m is the length of each string.
