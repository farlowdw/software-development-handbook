Given the `root` of a binary tree, the depth of each node is **the shortest distance to the root**.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains **all the deepest nodes** in the original tree.

A node is called **the deepest** if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The **subtree** of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.
