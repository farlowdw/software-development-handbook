There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a tournament.

Given a **0-indexed** 2D boolean matrix `grid` of size `n * n`. For all `i`, `j` that `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `i != j` team `i` is **stronger** than team `j` if `grid[i][j] == 1`, otherwise, team `j` is **stronger** than team `i`.

Team `a` will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is no team `b` that is stronger than team `a`.

Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament.
