You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

Split the array into **one or more** disjoint subarrays such that:

- Each element of the array belongs to **exactly one** subarray, and
- The **GCD** of the elements of each subarray is strictly greater than `1`.

Return the minimum number of subarrays that can be obtained after the split.

**Note** that:

- The **GCD** of a subarray is the largest positive integer that evenly divides all the elements of the subarray.
- A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.
