You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color** you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i`th color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.

Return the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling `orders` colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
