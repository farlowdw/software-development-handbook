```
func modify(arr, op, idx) {
  //add by 1 index idx
  if (op == 0) {
    arr[idx] = arr[idx] + 1
  }
  //multiply by 2 all elements
  if (op == 1) {
    for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      arr[i] = arr[i] * 2
    }
  }
}
```

Your task is to form an integer array `nums` from an initial array of zeros `arr` that is the same size as `nums`.

Return the minimum number of function calls to make `nums` from `arr`.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
