We call a string `s` of **even** length `n` an **anti-palindrome** if for each index `0 <= i < n`, `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]`.

Given a string `s`, your task is to make `s` an **anti-palindrome** by doing **any** number of operations (including zero).

In one operation, you can select two characters from `s` and swap them.

Return the resulting string. If multiple strings meet the conditions, return the lexicographically smallest one. If it can't be made into an anti-palindrome, return `"-1"`.
