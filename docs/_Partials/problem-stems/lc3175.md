A competition consists of `n` players numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `skills` of size `n` and a **positive** integer `k`, where `skills[i]` is the skill level of player `i`. All integers in `skills` are **unique**.

All players are standing in a queue in order from player `0` to player `n - 1`.

The competition process is as follows:

- The first two players in the queue play a game, and the player with the **higher** skill level wins.
- After the game, the winner stays at the beginning of the queue, and the loser goes to the end of it.

The winner of the competition is the **first** player who wins `k` games **in a row**.

Return the initial index of the winning player.
