Given an array of `digits` which is sorted in **non-decreasing** order. You can write numbers using each `digits[i]` as many times as we want. For example, if `digits = ['1','3','5']`, we may write numbers such as `'13'`, `'551'`, and `'1351315'`.

Return the number of positive integers that can be generated that are less than or equal to a given integer `n`.
