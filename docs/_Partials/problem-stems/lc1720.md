There is a **hidden** integer array `arr` that consists of `n` non-negative integers.

It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`. For example, if `arr = [1,0,2,1]`, then `encoded = [1,2,3]`.

You are given the `encoded` array. You are also given an integer `first`, that is the first element of `arr`, i.e. `arr[0]`.

Return the original array `arr`. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.
