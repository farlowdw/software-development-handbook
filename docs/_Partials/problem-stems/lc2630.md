Given a function `fn`, return a **memoized** version of that function.

A **memoized** function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.

`fn` can be any function and there are no constraints on what type of values it accepts. Inputs are considered identical if they are `===` to each other.
