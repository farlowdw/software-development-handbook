Implementing the class `MajorityChecker`, which has the following API:

- `MajorityChecker(int[] arr)` constructs an instance of MajorityChecker with the given array `arr`;
- `int query(int left, int right, int threshold)` has arguments such that:
  + `0 <= left <= right < arr.length` representing a subarray of `arr`;
  + `2 * threshold > right - left + 1`, ie. the threshold is always a strict majority of the length of the subarray

Each `query(...)` returns the element in `arr[left], arr[left+1], ..., arr[right]` that occurs at least threshold times, or `-1` if no such element exists.
