You are given a string `target`.

Alice is going to type `target` on her computer using a special keyboard that has **only two** keys:

- Key 1 appends the character `"a"` to the string on the screen.
- Key 2 changes the **last** character of the string on the screen to its **next** character in the English alphabet. For example, `"c"` changes to `"d"` and `"z"` changes to `"a"`.

**Note** that initially there is an empty string `""` on the screen, so she can **only** press key `1`.

Return a list of all strings that appear on the screen as Alice types `target`, in the order they appear, using the **minimum** key presses.
