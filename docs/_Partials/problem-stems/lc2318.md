You are given an integer `n`. You roll a fair 6-sided dice `n` times. Determine the total number of **distinct** sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The **greatest common divisor** of any **adjacent** values in the sequence is equal to `1`.
2. There is **at least** a gap of `2` rolls between **equal** valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the `i`th roll is **equal** to the value of the `j`th roll, then `abs(i - j) > 2`.

Return the **total number** of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.
