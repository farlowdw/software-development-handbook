There are `n` points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The `n` points on the road are labeled from `1` to `n` in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point `1` to point `n` to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.

The passengers are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `rides`, where <code>rides[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, tip<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the `i`th passenger requesting a ride from point <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to point <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> who is willing to give a <code>tip<sub>i</sub></code> dollar tip.

For **each** passenger `i` you pick up, you **earn** <code>end<sub>i</sub> - start<sub>i</sub> + tip<sub>i</sub></code> dollars. You may only drive **at most one** passenger at a time.

Given `n` and `rides`, return the **maximum** number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.

**Note:** You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.
