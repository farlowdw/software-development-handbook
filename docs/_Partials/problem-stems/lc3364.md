You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `l` and `r`. Your task is to find the **minimum** sum of a **subarray** whose size is between `l` and `r` (inclusive) and whose sum is greater than `0`.

Return the **minimum** sum of such a subarray. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.
