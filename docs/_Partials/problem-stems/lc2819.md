You are given an integer array `prices`, which shows the chocolate prices and a 2D integer array `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [k<sub>i</sub>, m<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

Alice and Bob went to buy some chocolates, and Alice suggested a way to pay for them, and Bob agreed.

The terms for each query are as follows:

- If the price of a chocolate is **less than or equal to** <code>k<sub>i</sub></code>, Bob pays for it.
- Otherwise, Bob pays <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> of it, and Alice pays the **rest**.

Bob wants to select **exactly** <code>m<sub>i</sub></code> chocolates such that his **relative loss** is **minimized**, more formally, if, in total, Alice has paid <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and Bob has paid <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>, Bob wants to minimize <code>b<sub>i</sub> - a<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return an integer array `ans` where `ans[i]` is Bob's **minimum relative loss** possible for `queries[i]`.
