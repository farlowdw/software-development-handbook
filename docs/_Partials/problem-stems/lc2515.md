You are given a **0-indexed** circular string array `words` and a string `target`. A **circular array** means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.

- Formally, the next element of `words[i]` is `words[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `words[i]` is `words[(i - 1 + n) % n]`, where `n` is the length of `words`.

Starting from `startIndex`, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with `1` step at a time.

Return the **shortest** distance needed to reach the string `target`. If the string `target` does not exist in `words`, return `-1`.
