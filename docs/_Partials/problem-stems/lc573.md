There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid. Your goal is to find the **minimal** distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most **one nut** at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.
