You are given a string `s`, where every **two** consecutive vertical bars `'|'` are grouped into a **pair**. In other words, the 1st and 2nd `'|'` make a pair, the 3rd and 4th `'|'` make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of `'*'` in `s`, **excluding** the `'*'` between each pair of `'|'`.

**Note** that each `'|'` will belong to **exactly** one pair.
