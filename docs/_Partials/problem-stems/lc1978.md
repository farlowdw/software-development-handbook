**Table:** `Employees`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key for this table.
- This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the id of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (`manager_id` is `null`). 

Write an SQL query to report the ids of the employees whose manager left the company and their salary is strictly less than `$30000`. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the `Employees` table.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+

Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
+-------------+
```

- The employees with a salary less than `$30000` are `1` and `11`.
- The manager of employee `1` is still in the company.
- The manager of employee `11` is employee `6` who left the company, so we return employee `11`.
