You are given `n` pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair `(c, d)` can follow another pair `(a, b)` if and only if `b < c`. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.
