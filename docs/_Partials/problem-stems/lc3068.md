There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given a **positive** integer `k`, and a **0-indexed** array of **non-negative** integers `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]` represents the **value** of the node numbered `i`.

Bogdan wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be **maximum**, for which Bogdan can perform the following operation **any** number of times (**including zero**) on the tree:

- Choose any edge `[u, v]` connecting the nodes `u` and `v`, and update their values as follows:
  + `nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k`
  + `nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k`

Return the **maximum** possible **sum** of the **values** Bogdan can achieve by performing the operation **any** number of times.
