You are given a binary array `possible` of length `n`.

Danielchandg and Bob are playing a game that consists of `n` levels. Some of the levels in the game are **impossible** to clear while others can **always** be cleared. In particular, if `possible[i] == 0`, then the `i`th level is **impossible** to clear for **both** the players. A player gains `1` point on clearing a level and loses `1` point if the player fails to clear it.

At the start of the game, Danielchandg will play some levels in the **given order** starting from the `0`th level, after which Bob will play for the rest of the levels.

Danielchandg wants to know the **minimum** number of levels he should play to gain more points than Bob, if both players play optimally to **maximize** their points.

Return the **minimum** number of levels danielchandg should play to gain more points. If this is **not** possible, return `-1`.

**Note** that each player must play at least `1` level.
