Given a string of digits `s`, return the number of **palindromic subsequences** of `s` having length `5`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note:**

- A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.
- A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
