You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and are tasked with finding two **non-intersecting palindromic** substrings of **odd** length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.

More formally, you want to choose four integers `i`, `j`, `k`, `l` such that `0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length` and both the substrings `s[i...j]` and `s[k...l]` are palindromes and have odd lengths. `s[i...j]` denotes a substring from index `i` to index `j` **inclusive**.

Return the **maximum** possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.

A **palindrome** is a string that is the same forward and backward. A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
