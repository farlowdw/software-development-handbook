You are given a 2D integer array `edges` representing an **undirected** graph having `n` nodes, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:

- The grid contains **all nodes** from `0` to `n - 1` in its cells, with each node appearing exactly **once**.
- Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (**horizontally** or **vertically**) **if and only if** there is an edge between them in `edges`.

It is guaranteed that `edges` can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
