You are given a positive integer `p`. Consider an array `nums` (**1-indexed**) that consists of the integers in the **inclusive** range <code>[1, 2<sup>p</sup> - 1]</code> in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation **any** number of times:

- Choose two elements `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Choose a bit in `x` and swap it with its corresponding bit in `y`. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the **same position** in the other integer.

For example, if <code>x = 11<u>0</u>1</code> and <code>y = 00<u>1</u>1</code>, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have <code>x = 11<u>1</u>1</code> and <code>y = 00<u>0</u>1</code>.

Find the **minimum non-zero** product of `nums` after performing the above operation **any** number of times. Return this product **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note:** The answer should be the minimum product **before** the modulo operation is done.
