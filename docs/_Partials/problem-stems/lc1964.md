You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `obstacles` of length `n`, where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of the `i`th obstacle.

For every index `i` between `0` and `n - 1` (**inclusive**), find the length of the **longest obstacle course** in `obstacles` such that:

- You choose any number of obstacles between `0` and `i` **inclusive**.
- You must include the `i`th obstacle in the course.
- You must put the chosen obstacles in the **same order** as they appear in `obstacles`.
- Every obstacle (except the first) is **taller** than or the **same height** as the obstacle immediately before it.

Return an array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i]` is the length of the **longest obstacle course** for index `i` as described above.
