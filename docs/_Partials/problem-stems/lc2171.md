You are given an array of **positive** integers `beans`, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.

**Remove** any number of beans (**possibly none**) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining **non-empty** bag (still containing **at least one** bean) is **equal**. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are **not** allowed to return it to any of the bags.

Return the **minimum** number of magic beans that you have to remove.
