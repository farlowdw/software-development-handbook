You are given three integers `m`, `n`, and `k`.

There is a rectangular grid of size `m Ã— n` containing `k` identical pieces. Return the sum of Manhattan distances between every pair of pieces over all **valid arrangements** of pieces.

A **valid arrangement** is a placement of all `k` pieces on the grid with **at most** one piece per cell.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and <code>(x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>)</code> is <code>|x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>| + |y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>|</code>.
