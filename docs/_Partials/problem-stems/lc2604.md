There are `n` hens and `m` grains on a line. You are given the initial positions of the hens and the grains in two integer arrays `hens` and `grains` of size `n` and `m` respectively.

Any hen can eat a grain if they are on the same position. The time taken for this is negligible. One hen can also eat multiple grains.

In `1` second, a hen can move right or left by `1` unit. The hens can move simultaneously and independently of each other.

Return the **minimum** time to eat all grains if the hens act optimally.
