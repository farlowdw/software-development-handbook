You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of **positive** integers. You can move from a cell in the matrix to **any** other cell that is either to the bottom or to the right (not necessarily adjacent). The score of a move from a cell with the value `c1` to a cell with the value `c2` is `c2 - c1`.

You can start at **any** cell, and you have to make **at least** one move.

Return the **maximum** total score you can achieve.
