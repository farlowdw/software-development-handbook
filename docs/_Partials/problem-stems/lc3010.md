You are given an array of integers `nums` of length `n`.

The **cost** of an array is the value of its **first** element. For example, the cost of `[1,2,3]` is `1` while the cost of `[3,4,1]` is `3`.

You need to divide `nums` into `3` **disjoint contiguous** subarrays.

Return the **minimum** possible **sum** of the cost of these subarrays.
