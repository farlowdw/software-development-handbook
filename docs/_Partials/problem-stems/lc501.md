Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
