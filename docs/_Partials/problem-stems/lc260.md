Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
