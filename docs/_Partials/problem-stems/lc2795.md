Given an array `functions`, return a promise `promise`. `functions` is an array of functions that return promises `fnPromise`. Each `fnPromise` can be resolved or rejected.  

If `fnPromise` is resolved:

```
obj = { status: "fulfilled", value: resolved value}
```

If `fnPromise` is rejected:

```
obj = { status: "rejected", reason: reason of rejection (catched error message)}
```

The `promise` should resolve with an array of these objects `obj`. Each `obj` in the array should correspond to the promises in the original array function, **maintaining the same order**.

Try to implement it without using the built-in method `Promise.allSettled()`.
