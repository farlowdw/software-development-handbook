Given an array of asyncronous functions `functions` and a **pool limit** `n`, return an asyncronous function `promisePool`. It should return a promise that resolves when all the input functions resolve.

**Pool limit** is defined as the maximum number promises that can be pending at once. `promisePool` should begin execution of as many functions as possible and continue executing new functions when old promises resolve. `promisePool` should execute `functions[i]` then `functions[i + 1]` then `functions[i + 2]`, etc. When the last promise resolves, `promisePool` should also resolve.

For example, if `n = 1`, `promisePool` will execute one function at a time in series. However, if `n = 2`, it first executes two functions. When either of the two functions resolve, a 3rd function should be executed (if available), and so on until there are no functions left to execute.

You can assume all `functions` never reject. It is acceptable for `promisePool` to return a promise that resolves any value.
