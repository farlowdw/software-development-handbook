You are at a fruit market with different types of exotic fruits on display.

You are given a **1-indexed** array `prices`, where `prices[i]` denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the `i`th fruit.

The fruit market has the following offer:

- If you purchase the `i`th fruit at `prices[i]` coins, you can get the next `i` fruits for free.

**Note** that even if you **can** take fruit `j` for free, you can still purchase it for `prices[j]` coins to receive a new offer.

Return the **minimum** number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.
