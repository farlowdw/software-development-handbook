Given an array `A` of integers, return the **length** of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `A`.

Recall that a subsequence of `A` is a list `A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k]` with `0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1`, and that a sequence `B` is arithmetic if `B[i+1] - B[i]` are all the same value (for `0 <= i < B.length - 1`).
