You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. You are asked to solve `n` queries for each integer `i` in the range `0 <= i < n`.

To solve the `i`th query:

1. Find the **minimum value** in each possible subarray of size `i + 1` of the array `nums`.
2. Find the **maximum** of those minimum values. This maximum is the **answer** to the query.

Return a **0-indexed** integer array `ans` of size `n` such that `ans[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
