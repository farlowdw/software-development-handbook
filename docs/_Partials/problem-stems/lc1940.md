Given an array of integer `arrays` arrays where each `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order, return an integer array representing the **longest common subsequence** between **all** the arrays.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.
