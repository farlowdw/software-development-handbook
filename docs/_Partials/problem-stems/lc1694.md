You are given a phone number as a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`.

You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, **remove** all spaces and dashes. Then, **group** the digits from left to right into blocks of length `3` **until** there are `4` or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:

- 2 digits: A single block of length 2.
- 3 digits: A single block of length 3.
- 4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.

The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should **never** produce any blocks of length 1 and produce **at most** two blocks of length 2.

Return the phone number after formatting.
