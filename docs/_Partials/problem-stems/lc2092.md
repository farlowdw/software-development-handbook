You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` people numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `meetings` where <code>meetings[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that person <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and person <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> have a meeting at time<sub>i</sub>. A person may attend **multiple meetings** at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer `firstPerson`.

Person `0` has a **secret** and initially shares the secret with a person `firstPerson` at time `0`. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> has the secret at time<sub>i</sub>, then they will share the secret with person <code>y<sub>i</sub></code>, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared **instantaneously**. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in **any order**.
