You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Define a function <code>distance(s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>)</code> between two strings <code>s<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>s<sub>2</sub></code> of the same length `n` as:

- The **sum** of the **minimum distance** between <code>s<sub>1</sub>[i]</code> and <code>s<sub>2</sub>[i]</code> when the characters from `'a'` to `'z'` are placed in a **cyclic** order, for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

For example, `distance("ab", "cd") == 4`, and `distance("a", "z") == 1`.

You can **change** any letter of `s` to **any** other lowercase English letter, **any** number of times.

Return a string denoting the **lexicographically smallest** string `t` you can get after some changes, such that `distance(s, t) <= k`.
