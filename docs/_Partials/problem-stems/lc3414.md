You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where <code>intervals[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code>. Interval `i` starts at position <code>l<sub>i</sub></code> and ends at <code>r<sub>i</sub></code>, and has a weight of <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>. You can choose up to `4` **non-overlapping** intervals. The **score** of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their weights.

Return the lexicographically smallest array of at most `4` indices from `intervals` with **maximum** score, representing your choice of non-overlapping intervals.

Two intervals are said to be non-overlapping if they do not share any points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.
