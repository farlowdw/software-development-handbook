A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point `(0, 0)` and faces north. The robot can receive one of three possible types of `commands`:

- `-2`: turn left `90` degrees,
- `-1`: turn right `90` degrees, or
- `1 <= k <= 9`: move forward `k` units.

Some of the grid squares are `obstacles`. The `i`th obstacle is at grid point <code>obstacles[i] = (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code>. 

If the robot would try to move onto them, the robot stays on the previous grid square instead (but still continues following the rest of the route.)

Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot will be from the origin **squared** (i.e. if the distance is `5`, return `25`).

**Note:**

- North means +Y direction.
- East means +X direction.
- South means -Y direction.
- West means -X direction.
