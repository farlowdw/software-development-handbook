You are asked to design a file system that allows you to create new paths and associate them with different values.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `/` followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, `"/leetcode"` and `"/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string `""` and `"/"` are not.

Implement the `FileSystem` class:

- `bool createPath(string path, int value)` Creates a new `path` and associates a `value` to it if possible and returns `true`. Returns `false` if the path **already exists** or its parent path **doesn't exist**.
- `int get(string path)` Returns the value associated with `path` or returns `-1` if the path doesn't exist.
