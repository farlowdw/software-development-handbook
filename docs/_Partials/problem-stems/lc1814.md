You are given an array `nums` that consists of non-negative integers. Let us define `rev(x)` as the reverse of the non-negative integer `x`. For example, `rev(123) = 321`, and `rev(120) = 21`. A pair of indices `(i, j)` is **nice** if it satisfies all of the following conditions:

- `0 <= i < j < nums.length`
- `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`

Return the number of nice pairs of indices. Since that number can be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
