Given a `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of the `grid` has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of `grid[i][j]` can be:

- **1** which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e., go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j + 1]`)
- **2** which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e., go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j - 1]`)
- **3** which means go to the lower cell. (i.e., go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i + 1][j]`)
- **4** which means go to the upper cell. (i.e., go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i - 1][j]`)

Notice that there could be some **invalid signs** on the cells of the `grid` which points outside the `grid`.

You will initially start at the upper left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` following the signs on the grid. The valid path **doesn't have to be the shortest**.

You can modify the sign on a cell with `cost = 1`. You can modify the sign on a cell **one time only**.

Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
