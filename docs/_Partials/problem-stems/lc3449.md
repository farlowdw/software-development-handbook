You are given an array `points` of size `n` and an integer `m`. There is another array `gameScore` of size `n`, where `gameScore[i]` represents the score achieved at the `i`th game. Initially, `gameScore[i] == 0` for all `i`.

You start at index `-1`, which is outside the array (before the first position at index `0`). You can make at most `m` moves. In each move, you can either:

- Increase the index by `1` and add `points[i]` to `gameScore[i]`.
- Decrease the index by `1` and add `points[i]` to `gameScore[i]`.

Note that the index must always remain within the bounds of the array after the first move.

Return the maximum possible minimum value in `gameScore` after at most `m` moves.
