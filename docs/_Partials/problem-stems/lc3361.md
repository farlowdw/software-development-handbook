You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, and two integer arrays `nextCost` and `previousCost`.

In one operation, you can pick any index `i` of `s`, and perform **either one** of the following actions:

- Shift `s[i]` to the next letter in the alphabet. If `s[i] == 'z'`, you should replace it with `'a'`. This operation costs `nextCost[j]` where `j` is the index of `s[i]` in the alphabet.
- Shift `s[i]` to the previous letter in the alphabet. If `s[i] == 'a'`, you should replace it with `'z'`. This operation costs `previousCost[j]` where `j` is the index of `s[i]` in the alphabet.

The **shift distance** is the **minimum** total cost of operations required to transform `s` into `t`.

Return the **shift distance** from `s` to `t`.
