Given an integer `num`, return a string representing its hexadecimal representation. For negative integers, [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.

All the letters in the answer string should be lowercase characters, and there should not be any leading zeros in the answer except for the zero itself.
