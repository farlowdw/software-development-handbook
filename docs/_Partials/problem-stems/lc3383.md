Alice has just graduated from wizard school, and wishes to cast a magic spell to celebrate. The magic spell contains certain **focus points** where magic needs to be concentrated, and some of these focus points contain **magic crystals** which serve as the spell's energy source. Focus points can be linked through **directed runes**, which channel magic flow from one focus point to another.

You are given a integer `n` denoting the number of focus points and an array of integers `crystals` where `crystals[i]` indicates a focus point which holds a magic crystal. You are also given two integer arrays `flowFrom` and `flowTo`, which represent the existing **directed runes**. The `i`th rune allows magic to freely flow from focus point `flowFrom[i]` to focus point `flowTo[i]`.

You need to find the number of directed runes Alice must add to her spell, such that each focus point either:

- **Contains** a magic crystal.
- **Receives** magic flow from another focus point.

Return the **minimum** number of directed runes that she should add.
