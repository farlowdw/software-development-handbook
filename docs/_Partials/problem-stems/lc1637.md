Given `n` points on a 2D plane where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>, Return the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.
