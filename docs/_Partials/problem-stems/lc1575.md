You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` **cannot** become negative at any point in time, and that you are **allowed** to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return the count of all possible routes from `start` to `finish`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
