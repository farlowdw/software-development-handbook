We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a `0` or a `1`.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a `1` has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node `X` is `X`, plus every node that is a descendant of `X`.)
