Given a set of words **(without duplicates)**, find all [word squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square) you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> row and column read the exact same string, where `0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns)`.

For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

```
b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y
```

**Note:**

1. There are at least `1` and at most `1000` words.
2. All words will have the exact same length.
3. Word length is at least `1` and at most `5`.
4. Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet `a-z`.
