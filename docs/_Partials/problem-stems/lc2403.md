You are given an integer array `power` where `power[i]` is the power of the `i`th monster.

You start with `0` mana points, and each day you increase your mana points by `gain` where `gain` initially is equal to `1`.

Each day, after gaining `gain` mana, you can defeat a monster if your mana points are greater than or equal to the power of that monster. When you defeat a monster:

- your mana points will be reset to `0`, and
- the value of `gain` increases by `1`.

Return the **minimum** number of days needed to defeat all the monsters.
