You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` and a **0-indexed** array `queries`.

You can do the following operation at the beginning **at most once**:

- Replace `nums` with a subsequence of `nums`.

We start processing queries in the given order; for each query, we do the following:

- If the first **and** the last element of `nums` is **less than** `queries[i]`, the processing of queries **ends**.
- Otherwise, we choose either the first **or** the last element of `nums` if it is **greater than or equal to** `queries[i]`, and we **remove** the chosen element from `nums`.

Return the **maximum** number of queries that can be processed by doing the operation optimally.
