You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where `m` and `n` are both **even** integers, and an integer `k`.

The matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:

<p align='center'>
  <img width='225px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/1914-f1.png').default} />
</p>

A cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating **each layer** in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the **counter-clockwise** direction. An example rotation is shown below:

<p align='center'>
  <img width='425px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/1914-f2.png').default} />
</p>

Return the matrix after applying `k` cyclic rotations to it.
