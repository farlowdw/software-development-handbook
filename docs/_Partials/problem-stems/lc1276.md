Given two integers `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`. The ingredients of different burgers are as follows:

- **Jumbo Burger**: 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
- **Small Burger**: 2 Tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.

Return `[total_jumbo, total_small]` so that the number of remaining `tomatoSlices` equal to `0` and the number of remaining `cheeseSlices` equal to `0`. If it is not possible to make the remaining `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` equal to `0` return `[]`.
