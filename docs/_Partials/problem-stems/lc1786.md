There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight equal to <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes <code>[z<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, ..., z<sub>k</sub>]</code> such that <code>z<sub>0</sub> = start</code> and <code>z<sub>k</sub> = end</code> and there is an edge between <code>z<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>z<sub>i+1</sub></code> where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A **restricted path** is a path that also satisfies that <code>distanceToLastNode(z<sub>i</sub>) > distanceToLastNode(z<sub>i+1</sub>)</code> where <code>0 <= i <= k-1</code>.

Return the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
