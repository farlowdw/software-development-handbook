There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. In this country, there is a road connecting **every pair** of cities.

There are `m` friends numbered from `0` to `m - 1` who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city **more than once**, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.

Given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `paths` where `paths[i]` is an integer array representing the path of the `i`th friend, return the length of the **longest common subpath** that is shared by **every** friend's path, or `0` if there is no common subpath at all.

A **subpath** of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.
