You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` representing the cost of collecting different chocolates. The cost of collecting the chocolate at the index `i` is `nums[i]`. Each chocolate is of a different type, and initially, the chocolate at the index `i` is of `i`th type.

In one operation, you can do the following with an incurred **cost** of `x`:

- Simultaneously change the chocolate of `i`th type to `((i + 1) mod n)`th type for all chocolates.

Return the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like.
