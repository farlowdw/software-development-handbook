The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

- `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
- `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
- `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

- `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
- `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
  + There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
  + For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.
