Given the `edges` of a directed graph where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>, and two nodes `source` and `destination` of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`, that is:

- At least one path exists from the `source` node to the `destination` node
- If a path exists from the `source` node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to `destination`.
- The number of possible paths from `source` to `destination` is a finite number.

Return `true` if and only if all roads from `source` lead to `destination`.
