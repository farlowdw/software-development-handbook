You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The width of a column is the maximum **length** of its integers.

- For example, if `grid = [[-10], [3], [12]]`, the width of the only column is `3` since `-10` is of length `3`.

Return an integer array `ans` of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the width of the `i`th column.

The **length** of an integer `x` with `len` digits is equal to `len` if `x` is non-negative, and `len + 1` otherwise.
