You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a positive integer.

A **cornered path** is defined as a set of adjacent cells with **at most** one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either **horizontally** or **vertically** up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the **alternate** direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.

The **product** of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.

Return the **maximum** number of **trailing zeros** in the product of a cornered path found in `grid`.

Note:

- **Horizontal** movement means moving in either the left or right direction.
- **Vertical** movement means moving in either the up or down direction.
