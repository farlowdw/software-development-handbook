Given an array `nums` of integers, a move consists of choosing any element and **decreasing it by 1**.

An array `A` is a zigzag array if either:

- Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. `A[0] > A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < A[4] > ...`
- OR, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. `A[0] < A[1] > A[2] < A[3] > A[4] < ...`

Return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array `nums` into a zigzag array.
