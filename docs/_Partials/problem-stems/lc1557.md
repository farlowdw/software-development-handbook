Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a directed edge from node <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>to<sub>i</sub></code>.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
