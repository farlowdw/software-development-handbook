You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **concatenation** of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating their numerals.

- For example, the concatenation of `15`, `49` is `1549`.

The **concatenation value** of `nums` is initially equal to `0`. Perform this operation until `nums` becomes empty:

- If there exists more than one number in `nums`, pick the first element and last element in `nums` respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete the first and last element from `nums`.
- If one element exists, add its value to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete it.

Return the concatenation value of the `nums`.
