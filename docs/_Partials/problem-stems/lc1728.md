A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

- Players are represented by the characters `'C'` (Cat), `'M'` (Mouse).
- Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.
- Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.
- Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.
- There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in grid.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

- Mouse **moves first**, then they take turns to move.
- During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.
- `catJump`, `mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
- Staying in the same position is allowed.
- Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

- If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
- If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
- If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
- If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return `false`.
