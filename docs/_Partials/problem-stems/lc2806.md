Initially, you have a bank account balance of `100` dollars.

You are given an integer `purchaseAmount` representing the amount you will spend on a purchase in dollars.

At the store where you will make the purchase, the purchase amount is rounded to the **nearest multiple** of `10`. In other words, you pay a **non-negative** amount, `roundedAmount`, such that `roundedAmount` is a multiple of `10` and `abs(roundedAmount - purchaseAmount)` is **minimized**.

If there is more than one nearest multiple of `10`, the **largest multiple** is chosen.

Return an integer denoting your account balance after making a purchase worth `purchaseAmount` dollars from the store.

**Note:** `0` is considered to be a multiple of `10` in this problem.
