You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

A **subsequence** of `nums` having length `k` and consisting of **indices** <code>i<sub>0</sub> &lt; i<sub>1</sub> &lt; ... &lt; i<sub>k-1</sub></code> is **balanced** if the following holds:

- <code>nums[i<sub>j</sub>] - nums[i<sub>j-1</sub>] >= i<sub>j</sub> - i<sub>j-1</sub></code>, for every <code>j</code> in the range <code>[1, k - 1]</code>.

A **subsequence** of `nums` having length `1` is considered balanced.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** possible **sum of elements** in a **balanced** subsequence of `nums`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new **non-empty** array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (**possibly none**) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.
