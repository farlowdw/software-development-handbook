Given three integers `n`, `m` and `k`. Consider the following algorithm to find the maximum element of an array of positive integers:

```
maximum_value = -1
maximum_index = -1
search_cost = 0
n = arr.length
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (maximum_value < arr[i]) {
    maximum_value = arr[i]
    maximum_index = i
    search_cost = search_cost + 1
  }
}
return maximum_index
```

You should build the array arr which has the following properties:

- `arr` has exactly `n` integers.
- `1 <= arr[i] <= m` where (`0 <= i < n`).
- After applying the mentioned algorithm to `arr`, the value `search_cost` is equal to `k`.

Return the number of ways to build the array arr under the mentioned conditions. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
