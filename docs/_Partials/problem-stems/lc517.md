You have `n` super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty.

For each **move**, you could choose **any** `m` (`1 ≤ m ≤ n`) washing machines, and pass **one dress** of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines **at the same time**.

Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the **minimum number of moves** to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible to do it, return `-1`.
