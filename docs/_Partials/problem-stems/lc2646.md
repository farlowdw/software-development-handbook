There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array `price`, where `price[i]` is the price of the `i`th node.

The **price sum** of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `trips`, where <code>trips[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you start the `i`th trip from the node <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and travel to the node <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> by any path you like.

Before performing your first trip, you can choose some **non-adjacent** nodes and halve the prices.

Return the minimum total price sum to perform all the given trips.
