You are given two integer arrays `arr` and `brr` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operations on `arr` *any* number of times:

- Split `arr` into any number of **contiguous** subarrays and rearrange these subarrays in *any order*. This operation has a fixed cost of `k`.
- Choose any element in `arr` and add or subtract a positive integer `x` to it. The cost of this operation is `x`.

Return the **minimum** total cost to make `arr` equal to `brr`.
