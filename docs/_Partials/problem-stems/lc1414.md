Given an integer `k`, return the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to `k`. The same Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

- <code>F<sub>1</sub> = 1</code>
- <code>F<sub>2</sub> = 1</code>
- <code>F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub></code> for `n > 2`.

It is guaranteed that for the given constraints we can always find such Fibonacci numbers that sum up to `k`.
