DataFrame students
+-------------+--------+
| Column Name | Type   |
+-------------+--------+
| id          | int    |
| first       | object |
| last        | object |
| age         | int    |

Write a solution to rename the columns as follows:

- `id` to `student_id`
- `first` to `first_name`
- `last` to `last_name`
- `age` to `age_in_years`

The result format is in the following example.
