You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Build and return an integer array `result` with the same length as `nums` such that `result[i]` is equal to the **summation of absolute differences** between `nums[i]` and all the other elements in the array.

In other words, `result[i]` is equal to `sum(|nums[i]-nums[j]|)` where `0 <= j < nums.length` and `j != i` (**0-indexed**).
