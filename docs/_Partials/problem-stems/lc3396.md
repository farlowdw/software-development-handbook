You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to ensure that the elements in the array are **distinct**. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Remove 3 elements from the beginning of the array. If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.

**Note** that an empty array is considered to have distinct elements. Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.
