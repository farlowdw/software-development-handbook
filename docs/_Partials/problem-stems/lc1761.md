You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between <code>u<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>i</sub></code>.

A **connected trio** is a set of **three** nodes where there is an edge between **every** pair of them.

The **degree of a connected trio** is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return the **minimum** degree of a connected trio in the graph, or `-1` if the graph has no connected trios.
