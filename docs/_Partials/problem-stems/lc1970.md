There is a **1-based** binary matrix where `0` represents land and `1` represents water. You are given integers `row` and `col` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

Initially on day `0`, the **entire** matrix is **land**. However, each day a new cell becomes flooded with **water**. You are given a **1-based** 2D array `cells`, where <code>cells[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that on the `i`th day, the cell on the <code>r<sub>i</sub>th</code> row and <code>c<sub>i</sub>th</code> column (**1-based** coordinates) will be covered with **water** (i.e., changed to `1`).

You want to find the **last** day that it is possible to walk from the **top** to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells. You can start from **any** cell in the top row and end at **any** cell in the bottom row. You can only travel in the **four** cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).

Return the **last** day where it is possible to walk from the **top** to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells.
