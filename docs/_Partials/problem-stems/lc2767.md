Given a binary string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such that each substring is **beautiful**.

A string is **beautiful** if:

- It doesn't contain leading zeros.
- It's the binary representation of a number that is a power of `5`.

Return the **minimum** number of substrings in such partition. If it is impossible to partition the string `s` into beautiful substrings, return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
