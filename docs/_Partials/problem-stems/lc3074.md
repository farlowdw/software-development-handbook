You are given an array `apple` of size `n` and an array `capacity` of size `m`.

There are `n` packs where the `i`th pack contains `apple[i]` apples. There are `m` boxes as well, and the `i`th box has a capacity of `capacity[i]` apples.

Return the **minimum** number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these `n` packs of apples into boxes.

**Note** that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.
