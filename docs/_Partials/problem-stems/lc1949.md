**Table:** `Friendship`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user1_id    | int  |
| user2_id    | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `(user1_id, user2_id)` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates that the users `user1_id` and `user2_id` are friends. Note that `user1_id < user2_id`.

A friendship between a **pair of friends** `x` and `y` is **strong** if `x` and `y` have **at least three** common friends. 

Write an SQL query to find all the **strong friendships**. 

Note that the result table should not contain duplicates with `user1_id < user2_id`. 

Return the result table in **any order**. 

The query result format is in the following example (note that `x` and `y` must have at least 3 friends in common *and also be friends with each other*):

```
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 1        | 5        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 1        | 7        |
| 3        | 7        |
| 1        | 6        |
| 3        | 6        |
| 2        | 6        |
+----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+----------+---------------+
| user1_id | user2_id | common_friend |
+----------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 2        | 4             |
| 1        | 3        | 3             |
+----------+----------+---------------+
```

- Users `1` and `2` have `4` common friends (`3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`).
- Users `1` and `3` have `3` common friends (`2`, `6`, and `7`).
- We did not include the friendship of users `2` and `3` because they only have two common friends (`1` and `6`).
