Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, `p` and `q`. If either node `p` or `q` **does not exist** in the tree, return `null`. All values of the nodes in the tree are **unique**.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as **descendants** (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)". A **descendant** of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.
