There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where <code>trips[i] = [numPassengers<sub>i</sub>, from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the `i`th trip has <code>numPassengers<sub>i</sub></code> passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or `false` otherwise.
