You are given two strings `s` and `t`, both of which are anagrams of each other, and an integer `k`.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to split the string `s` into `k` equal-sized substrings, rearrange the substrings, and concatenate them in any order to create a new string that matches the given string `t`.

Return `true` if this is possible, otherwise, return `false`.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.
