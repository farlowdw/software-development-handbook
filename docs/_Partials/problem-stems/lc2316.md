You are given an integer `n`. There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return the **number of pairs** of different nodes that are **unreachable** from each other.
