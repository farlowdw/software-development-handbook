You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace **any** element in `nums` with **any** integer.

`nums` is considered **continuous** if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- All elements in `nums` are **unique**.
- The difference between the **maximum** element and the **minimum** element in `nums` equals `nums.length - 1`.

For example, `nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]` is **continuous**, but `nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` is **not continuous**.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make `nums` **continuous**.
