You are given an integer array `rewardValues` of length `n`, representing the values of rewards.

Initially, your total reward `x` is 0, and all indices are **unmarked**. You are allowed to perform the following operation **any** number of times:

- Choose an **unmarked** index `i` from the range `[0, n - 1]`.
- If `rewardValues[i]` is **greater** than your current total reward `x`, then add `rewardValues[i]` to `x` (i.e., `x = x + rewardValues[i]`), and **mark** the index `i`.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** total reward you can collect by performing the operations optimally.
