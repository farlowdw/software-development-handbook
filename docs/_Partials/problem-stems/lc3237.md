There are `n` windows open numbered from `1` to `n`, we want to simulate using alt + tab to navigate between the windows.

You are given an array `windows` which contains the initial order of the windows (the first element is at the top and the last one is at the bottom).

You are also given an array `queries` where for each query, the window `queries[i]` is brought to the top.

Return the final state of the array `windows`.
