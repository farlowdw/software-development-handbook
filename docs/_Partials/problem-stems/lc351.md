Android devices have a special lock screen with a `3 x 3` grid of dots. Users can set an "unlock pattern" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of `k` dots is a **valid** unlock pattern if both of the following are true:

- All the dots in the sequence are **distinct**.
- If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through any other dot, the other dot **must have previously appeared** in the sequence. No jumps through non-selected dots are allowed.

Here are some example valid and invalid unlock patterns:

</p>

- The 1st pattern `[4,1,3,6]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `3` pass through dot `2`, but dot `2` did not previously appear in the sequence.
- The 2nd pattern `[4,1,9,2]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `9` pass through dot `5`, but dot `5` did not previously appear in the sequence.
- The 3rd pattern `[2,4,1,3,6]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `3` meets the condition because dot `2` previously appeared in the sequence.
- The 4th pattern `[6,5,4,1,9,2]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `9` meets the condition because dot `5` previously appeared in the sequence.

Given two integers `m` and `n`, return the **number of unique and valid unlock patterns** of the Android grid lock screen that consist of **at least** `m` keys and **at most** `n` keys.

Two unlock patterns are considered **unique** if there is a dot in one sequence that is not in the other, or the order of the dots is different.
