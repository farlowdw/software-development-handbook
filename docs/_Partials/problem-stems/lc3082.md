You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a positive integer `k`.

The **power** of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences with their sum **equal** to `k`.

Return the **sum** of **power** of all subsequences of `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
