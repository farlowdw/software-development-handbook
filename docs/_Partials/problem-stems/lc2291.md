You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays of the same length `present` and `future` where `present[i]` is the current price of the `i`th stock and `future[i]` is the price of the `i`th stock a year in the future. You may buy each stock at most **once**. You are also given an integer `budget` representing the amount of money you currently have.

Return the maximum amount of profit you can make.
