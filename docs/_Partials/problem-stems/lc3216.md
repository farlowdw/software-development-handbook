Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after swapping **adjacent** digits in `s` with the same **parity** at most **once**.

Digits have the same parity if both are odd or both are even. For example, 5 and 9, as well as 2 and 4, have the same parity, while 6 and 9 do not.
