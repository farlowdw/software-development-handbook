There are `n` pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by `'A'` or by `'B'`. You are given a string `colors` of length `n` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i`th piece.

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take **alternating turns** removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves **first**.

- Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored `'A'` if **both its neighbors** are also colored `'A'`. She is **not allowed** to remove pieces that are colored `'B'`.
- Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored `'B'` if **both its neighbors** are also colored `'B'`. He is **not allowed** to remove pieces that are colored `'A'`.
- Alice and Bob **cannot** remove pieces from the edge of the line.
- If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player **loses** and the other player **wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` if Alice wins, or return `false` if Bob wins.
