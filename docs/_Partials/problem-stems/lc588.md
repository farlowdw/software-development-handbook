Design an in-memory file system to simulate the following functions:

`ls`: Given a path in string format. If it is a file path, return a list that only contains this file's name. If it is a directory path, return the list of file and directory names **in this directory**. Your output (file and directory names together) should in **lexicographic order**.

`mkdir`: Given a **directory path** that does not exist, you should make a new directory according to the path. If the middle directories in the path don't exist either, you should create them as well. This function has void return type.

`addContentToFile`: Given a **file path** and **file content** in string format. If the file doesn't exist, you need to create that file containing given content. If the file already exists, you need to **append** given content to original content. This function has void return type.

`readContentFromFile`: Given a **file path**, return its **content** in string format.
