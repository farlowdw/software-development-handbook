Given the **0-indexed** arrays `prices` and `profits` of length `n`. There are `n` items in an store where the `i`th item has a price of `prices[i]` and a profit of `profits[i]`.

We have to pick three items with the following condition:

- `prices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k]` where `i < j < k`.

If we pick items with indices `i`, `j` and `k` satisfying the above condition, the profit would be `profits[i] + profits[j] + profits[k]`.

Return the **maximum profit** we can get, and `-1` if it's not possible to pick three items with the given condition.
