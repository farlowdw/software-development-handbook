You are given a 2D array `points` and a string `s` where, `points[i]` represents the coordinates of point `i`, and `s[i]` represents the **tag** of point `i`.

A **valid** square is a square centered at the origin `(0, 0)`, has edges parallel to the axes, and **does not** contain two points with the same tag.

Return the **maximum** number of points contained in a **valid** square.

Note:

- A point is considered to be inside the square if it lies on or within the square's boundaries.
- The side length of the square can be zero.
