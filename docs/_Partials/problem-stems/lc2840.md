You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `n`, consisting of **lowercase** English letters.

You can apply the following operation on **any** of the two strings **any** number of times:

- Choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `i < j` and the difference `j - i` is **even**, then **swap** the two characters at those indices in the string.

Return `true` if you can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal, and `false` otherwise.
