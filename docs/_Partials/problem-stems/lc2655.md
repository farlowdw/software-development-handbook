You are given an integer `n` which is the length of a **0-indexed** array `nums`, and a **0-indexed** 2D-array `ranges`, which is a list of sub-ranges of `nums` (sub-ranges may **overlap**).

Each row `ranges[i]` has exactly 2 cells:

- `ranges[i][0]`, which shows the start of the `i`th range (inclusive)
- `ranges[i][1]`, which shows the end of the `i`th range (inclusive)

These ranges cover some cells of `nums` and leave some cells uncovered. Your task is to find all of the **uncovered** ranges with **maximal** length.

Return a 2D-array `answer` of the uncovered ranges, **sorted** by the starting point in **ascending order**.

By all of the **uncovered** ranges with **maximal** length, we mean satisfying two conditions:

- Each uncovered cell should belong to **exactly** one sub-range
- There should **not exist** two ranges `(l1, r1)` and `(l2, r2)` such that `r1 + 1 = l2`
