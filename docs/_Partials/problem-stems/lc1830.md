You are given a string `s` (**0-indexed**). You are asked to perform the following operation on `s` until you get a sorted string:

1. Find **the largest index** `i` such that `1 <= i < s.length` and `s[i] < s[i - 1]`.
2. Find **the largest index** `j` such that `i <= j < s.length` and `s[k] < s[i - 1]` for all the possible values of `k` in the range `[i, j]` inclusive.
3. Swap the two characters at indices `i - 1` and `j`.
4. Reverse the suffix starting at index `i`.

Return the number of operations needed to make the string sorted. Since the answer can be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
