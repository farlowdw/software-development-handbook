You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

The **frequency** of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in an array.

An array is called **good** if the frequency of each element in this array is **less than or equal** to `k`.

Return the length of the **longest good** subarray of `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
