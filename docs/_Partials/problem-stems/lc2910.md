You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

We want to group the indices so for each index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, it is assigned to **exactly one** group.

A group assignment is **valid** if the following conditions hold:

- For every group `g`, all indices `i` assigned to group `g` have the same value in `nums`.
- For any two groups <code>g<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>g<sub>2</sub></code>, the **difference** between the **number of indices** assigned to <code>g<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>g<sub>2</sub></code> should **not exceed** `1`.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of groups needed to create a valid group assignment.
