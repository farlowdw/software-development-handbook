Given an array of asynchronous functions `functions`, return a new promise `promise`. Each function in the array accepts no arguments and returns a promise.

`promise` resolves:

- When all the promises returned from `functions` were resolved successfully. The resolved value of `promise` should be an array of all the resolved values of promises in the same order as they were in the `functions`.

`promise` rejects:

- When any of the promises returned from `functions` were rejected. `promise` should also reject with the reason of the first rejection.

Please solve it without using the built-in `Promise.all` function.
