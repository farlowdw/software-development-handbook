You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **at most one** outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given **0-indexed** array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.

You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.

Return the **index** of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, such that the **maximum** between the distance from `node1` to that node, and from `node2` to that node is **minimized**. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the **smallest** index, and if no possible answer exists, return -1.

Note that `edges` may contain cycles.
