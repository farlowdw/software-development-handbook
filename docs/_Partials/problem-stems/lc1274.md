(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)

Each ship is located at an integer point on the sea represented by a cartesian plane, and each integer point may contain at most `1` ship.

You have a function `Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft)` which takes two points as arguments and returns `true`. If there is at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the two points, including on the boundary.

Given two points: the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle, return the number of ships present in that rectangle. It is guaranteed that there are **at most 10 ships** in that rectangle.

Submissions making **more than 400 calls** to `hasShips` will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
