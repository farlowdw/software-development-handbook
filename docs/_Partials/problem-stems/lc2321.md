You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

You can choose two integers `left` and `right` where `0 <= left <= right < n` and swap the subarray `nums1[left...right]` with the subarray `nums2[left...right]`.

- For example, if `nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `nums2 = [11,12,13,14,15]` and you choose `left = 1` and `right = 2`, `nums1` becomes <code>[1,<b><u>12</u></b>,<b><u>13</u></b>,4,5]</code> and `nums2` becomes <code>[11,<b><u>2</u></b>,<b><u>3</u></b>,14,15]</code>.

You may choose to apply the mentioned operation **once** or not do anything.

The **score** of the arrays is the **maximum** of `sum(nums1)` and `sum(nums2)`, where `sum(arr)` is the sum of all the elements in the array `arr`.

Return the **maximum possible score**.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array. `arr[left...right]` denotes the subarray that contains the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` (**inclusive**).
