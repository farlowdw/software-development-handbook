You are given an array `arr` of size `n` consisting of **non-empty** strings.

Find a string array `answer` of size `n` such that:

- `answer[i]` is the **shortest** substring of `arr[i]` that does **not** occur as a substring in any other string in `arr`. If multiple such substrings exist, `answer[i]` should be the lexicographically smallest. And if no such substring exists, `answer[i]` should be an empty string.

Return the array `answer`.
