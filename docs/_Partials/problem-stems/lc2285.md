You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `roads` where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a **bidirectional** road connecting cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from `1` to `n`, where each value can only be used **once**. The **importance** of a road is then defined as the **sum** of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the **maximum total importance** of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
