You are given a string `s` that consists of only digits.

Check if we can split `s` into **two or more non-empty substrings** such that the **numerical values** of the substrings are in **descending order** and the **difference** between numerical values of every two **adjacent substrings** is equal to `1`.

- For example, the string `s = "0090089"` can be split into `["0090", "089"]` with numerical values `[90,89]`. The values are in descending order and adjacent values differ by `1`, so this way is valid.
- Another example, the string `s = "001"` can be split into `["0", "01"]`, `["00", "1"]`, or `["0", "0", "1"]`. However all the ways are invalid because they have numerical values `[0,1]`, `[0,1]`, and `[0,0,1]` respectively, all of which are not in descending order.

Return `true` if it is possible to split `s` as described above, or `false` otherwise.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
