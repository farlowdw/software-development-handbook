We are given `hours`, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than `8`.

A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.
