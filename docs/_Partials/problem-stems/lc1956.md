There are `n` **unique** virus variants in an infinite 2D grid. You are given a 2D array `points`, where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a virus originating at <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> on day `0`. Note that it is possible for **multiple** virus variants to originate at the **same** point.

Every day, each cell infected with a virus variant will spread the virus to **all** neighboring points in the **four** cardinal directions (i.e. up, down, left, and right). If a cell has multiple variants, all the variants will spread without interfering with each other.

Given an integer `k`, return the **minimum integer** number of days for **any** point to contain **at least** `k` of the unique virus variants.
