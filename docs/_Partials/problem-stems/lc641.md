Design your implementation of the circular double-ended queue (deque).

Your implementation should support following operations:

- `MyCircularDeque(k)`: Constructor, set the size of the deque to be `k`.
- `insertFront()`: Adds an item at the front of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
- `insertLast()`: Adds an item at the rear of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
- `deleteFront()`: Deletes an item from the front of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
- `deleteLast()`: Deletes an item from the rear of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
- `getFront()`: Gets the front item from the Deque. If the deque is empty, return `-1`.
- `getRear()`: Gets the last item from Deque. If the deque is empty, return `-1`.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks whether Deque is empty or not. 
- `isFull()`: Checks whether Deque is full or not.
