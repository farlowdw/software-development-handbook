You are given an integer array `nums` of **even** length. You have to split the array into two parts `nums1` and `nums2` such that:

- `nums1.length == nums2.length == nums.length / 2`.
- `nums1` should contain **distinct** elements.
- `nums2` should also contain **distinct** elements.

Return `true` if it is possible to split the array, and `false` otherwise.
