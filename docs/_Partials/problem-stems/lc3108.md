There is an undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between vertices <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with a weight of <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the bitwise `AND` of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is <code>w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>k</sub></code>, then the cost is calculated as <code>w<sub>0</sub> & w<sub>1</sub> & w<sub>2</sub> & ... & w<sub>k</sub></code>, where `&` denotes the bitwise `AND` operator.

You are also given a 2D array `query`, where <code>query[i] = [s<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex <code>s<sub>i</sub></code> and ending at vertex <code>t<sub>i</sub></code>. If there exists no such walk, the answer is `-1`.

Return the array `answer`, where `answer[i]` denotes the **minimum** cost of a walk for query `i`.
