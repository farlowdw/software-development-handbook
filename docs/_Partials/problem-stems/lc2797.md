Given a function `fn` and an array `args`, return a function `partialFn`. 

Placeholders `"_"` in the args should be replaced with values from `restArgs` starting from index `0`. Any remaining values in the `restArgs` should be added at the end of the `args`.

`partialFn` should return a result of `fn`. `fn` should be called with the elements of the modified `args` passed as separate arguments.
