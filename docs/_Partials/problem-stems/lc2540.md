Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the **minimum integer common** to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`.

Note that an integer is said to be **common** to `nums1` and `nums2` if both arrays have **at least one** occurrence of that integer.
