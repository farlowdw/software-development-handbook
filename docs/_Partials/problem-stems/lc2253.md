CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS

INSERT INTO
  Products (product_id, store, price)
VALUES
  ('1', '100', NULL, '110', NULL),

**Table:** `Products`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store_name1 | int     |
| store_name2 | int     |
|      :      | int     |
|      :      | int     |
|      :      | int     |
| store_namen | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `product_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table indicates the product's price in `n` different stores.
- If the product is not available in a store, the price will be `null` in that store's column.
- The names of the stores may change from one testcase to another. There will be at least `1` store and at most `30` stores.

**Important note:** This problem targets those who have a good experience with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.

Implement the procedure `UnpivotProducts` to reorganize the `Products` table so that each row has the id of one product, the name of a store where it is sold, and its price in that store. If a product is not available in a store, do **not** include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table. There should be three columns: `product_id`, `store`, and `price`.

The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
