You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` and a **non-negative** integer `k`.

In one operation, you can do the following:

- Choose an index `i` that **hasn't been chosen before** from the range `[0, nums.length - 1]`.
- Replace `nums[i]` with any integer from the range `[nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]`.

The **beauty** of the array is the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements.

Return the **maximum** possible beauty of the array `nums` after applying the operation any number of times.

**Note** that you can apply the operation to each index **only once**.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.
