You are given two arrays with **positive** integers `arr1` and `arr2`.

A **prefix** of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits, starting from its **leftmost** digit. For example, `123` is a prefix of the integer `12345`, while `234` is **not**.

A **common prefix** of two integers `a` and `b` is an integer `c`, such that `c` is a prefix of both `a` and `b`. For example, `5655359` and `56554` have a common prefix `565` while `1223` and `43456` do not have a common prefix.

You need to find the length of the **longest common prefix** between all pairs of integers `(x, y)` such that `x` belongs to `arr1` and `y` belongs to `arr2`.

Return the length of the **longest** common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return `0`.
