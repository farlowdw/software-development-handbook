There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
