Define `S = [s,n]` as the string `S` which consists of `n` connected strings `s`. For example, `["abc", 3] ="abcabcabc"`.

On the other hand, we define that string `s1` can be obtained from string `s2` if we can remove some characters from `s2` such that it becomes `s1`. For example, `"abc"` can be obtained from `"abdbec"` based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from `"acbbe"`.

You are given two non-empty strings `s1` and `s2` (each at most `100` characters long) and two integers <code>0 ≤ n1 ≤ 10<sup>6</sup></code> and <code>0 ≤ n2 ≤ 10<sup>6</sup></code>. Now consider the strings `S1` and `S2`, where `S1=[s1,n1]` and `S2=[s2,n2]`. Find the maximum integer `M` such that `[S2,M]` can be obtained from `S1`.
