On a 2-dimensional `grid`, there are 4 types of squares:

- `1` represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
- `2` represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
- `0` represents empty squares we can walk over.
- `-1` represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that **walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once**.
