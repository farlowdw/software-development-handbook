You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` representing the height of each unit cell in a continent. The **Pacific ocean** touches the continent's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic ocean** touches the continent's right and bottom edges.

Water can only flow in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Water flows from a cell to an adjacent one with an equal or lower height.

Return a list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
