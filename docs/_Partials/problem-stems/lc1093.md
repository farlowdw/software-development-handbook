You are given a large sample of integers in the range `[0, 255]`. Since the sample is so large, it is represented by an array `count` where `count[k]` is the **number of times** that `k` appears in the sample.

Calculate the following statistics:

- `minimum`: The minimum element in the sample.
- `maximum`: The maximum element in the sample.
- `mean`: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
- `median`:
    + If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the `median` is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
    + If the sample has an even number of elements, then the `median` is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.
- `mode`: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be **unique**.

Return the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers `[minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]`. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.
