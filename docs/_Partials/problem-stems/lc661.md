Given a 2D integer matrix `M` representing the gray scale of an image, you need to design a smoother to make the gray scale of each cell becomes the average gray scale (rounding down) of all the `8` surrounding cells and itself. If a cell has less than `8` surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.
