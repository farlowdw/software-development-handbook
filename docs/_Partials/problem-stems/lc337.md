The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**.
