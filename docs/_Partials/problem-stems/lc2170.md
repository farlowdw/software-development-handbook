You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers.

The array `nums` is called **alternating** if:

- `nums[i - 2] == nums[i]`, where `2 <= i <= n - 1`.
- `nums[i - 1] != nums[i]`, where `1 <= i <= n - 1`.

In one **operation**, you can choose an index `i` and **change** `nums[i]` into **any** positive integer.

Return the **minimum number of operations** required to make the array alternating.
