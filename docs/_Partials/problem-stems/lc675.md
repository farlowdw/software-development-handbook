You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an `m x n` matrix. In this matrix:

- `0` means the cell cannot be walked through.
- `1` represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
- A number greater than `1` represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.

In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.

You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes `1` (an empty cell).

Starting from the point `(0, 0)`, return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return `-1`.

You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
