You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The cost of connecting two points <code>[x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> and <code>[x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>]</code> is the manhattan distance between them: <code>|x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>| + |y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>|</code>, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.
