You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `brackets` where <code>brackets[i] = [upper<sub>i</sub>, percent<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that the `i`th tax bracket has an upper bound of <code>upper<sub>i</sub></code> and is taxed at a rate of <code>percent<sub>i</sub></code>. The brackets are **sorted** by upper bound (i.e. <code>upper<sub>i-1</sub> < upper<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>0 < i < brackets.length</code>).

Tax is calculated as follows:

- The first <code>upper<sub>0</sub></code> dollars earned are taxed at a rate of <code>percent<sub>0</sub></code>.
- The next <code>upper<sub>1</sub> - upper<sub>0</sub></code> dollars earned are taxed at a rate of <code>percent<sub>1</sub></code>.
- The next <code>upper<sub>2</sub> - upper<sub>1</sub></code> dollars earned are taxed at a rate of <code>percent<sub>2</sub></code>.
- And so on.

You are given an integer `income` representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.
