You are given a string `number` representing a **positive integer** and a character `digit`.

Return the resulting string after removing **exactly one occurrence** of `digit` from `number` such that the value of the resulting string in **decimal** form is **maximized**. The test cases are generated such that `digit` occurs at least once in `number`.
