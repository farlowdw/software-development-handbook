A **happy string** is a string that:

- consists only of letters of the set `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
- `s[i] != s[i + 1]` for all values of `i` from `1` to `s.length - 1` (string is 1-indexed).

For example, strings `"abc"`, `"ac"`, `"b"` and `"abcbabcbcb"` are all happy strings and strings `"aa"`, `"baa"` and `"ababbc"` are not happy strings.

Given two integers `n` and `k`, consider a list of all happy strings of length `n` sorted in lexicographical order.

Return the kth string of this list or return an **empty string** if there are less than `k` happy strings of length `n`.
