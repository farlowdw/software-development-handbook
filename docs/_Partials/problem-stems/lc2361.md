A train line going through a city has two routes, the regular route and the express route. Both routes go through the **same** `n + 1` stops labeled from `0` to `n`. Initially, you start on the regular route at stop `0`.

You are given two **1-indexed** integer arrays `regular` and express, both of length `n`. `regular[i]` describes the cost it takes to go from stop `i - 1` to stop `i` using the regular route, and express[i] describes the cost it takes to go from stop `i - 1` to stop i using the express route.

You are also given an integer `expressCost` which represents the cost to transfer from the regular route to the express route.

Note that:

- There is no cost to transfer from the express route back to the regular route.
- You pay `expressCost` **every** time you transfer from the regular route to the express route.
- There is no extra cost to stay on the express route.

Return a **1-indexed** array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the **minimum** cost to reach stop `i` from stop `0`.

Note that a stop can be counted as **reached** from either route.
