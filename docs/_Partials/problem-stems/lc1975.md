You are given an `n x n` integer `matrix`. You can do the following operation **any** number of times:

- Choose any two **adjacent** elements of `matrix` and **multiply** each of them by `-1`.

Two elements are considered **adjacent** if and only if they share a **border**.

Your goal is to **maximize** the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the **maximum** sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.
