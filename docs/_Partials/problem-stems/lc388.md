Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

<p align='center'>
  <img width="550px" src={require('@site/static/img/lc/388-f1.png').default} />
</p>

Here, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):

```
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
```

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `"dir
	subdir1
		file1.ext
		subsubdir1
	subdir2
		subsubdir2
			file2.ext"`. Note that the `'
'` and `'	'` are the new-line and tab characters.

Every file and directory has a unique **absolute path** in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by `'/'s`. Using the above example, the **absolute path** to `file2.ext` is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

Given a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the **longest absolute path** to a **file** in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return `0`.
