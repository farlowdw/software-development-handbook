Let's play the minesweeper game ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), [online game](https://minesweeperonline.com/))!

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. `'M'` represents an **unrevealed** mine, `'E'` represents an unrevealed empty square, `'B'` represents a **revealed** blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, **digit** (`'1'` to `'8'`) represents how many mines are adjacent to this **revealed** square, and finally `'X'` represents a **revealed** mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the **unrevealed** squares (`'M'` or `'E'`), return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

1. If a mine (`'M'`) is revealed, then the game is over - change it to `'X'`.
2. If an empty square (`'E'`) with **no adjacent mines** is revealed, then change it to revealed blank (`'B'`) and all of its adjacent **unrevealed** squares should be revealed recursively.
3. If an empty square (`'E'`) with **at least one adjacent mine** is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
4. Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
