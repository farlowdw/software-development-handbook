You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. You are also given an integer `w`. Your task is to **cover all** the given points with rectangles.

Each rectangle has its lower end at some point <code>(x<sub>1</sub>, 0)</code> and its upper end at some point <code>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</code>, where <code>x<sub>1</sub> &lt;= x<sub>2</sub></code>, <code>y<sub>2</sub> >= 0</code>, and the condition <code>x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> &lt;= w</code> **must** be satisfied for each rectangle.

A point is considered covered by a rectangle if it lies within or on the boundary of the rectangle.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of rectangles needed so that each point is covered by **at least one** rectangle.

**Note:** A point may be covered by more than one rectangle.
