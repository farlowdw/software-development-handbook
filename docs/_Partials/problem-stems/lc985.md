We have an array `A` of integers, and an array `queries` of queries.

For the `i`th query `val = queries[i][0]`, `index = queries[i][1]`, we add `val` to `A[index]`.  Then, the answer to the `i`th query is the sum of the even values of `A`.

(Here, the given `index = queries[i][1]` is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array `A`.)

Return the answer to all queries. Your `answer` array should have `answer[i]` as the answer to the `i`th query.
