There is a row of `m` houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the n colors (labeled from `1` to `n`), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.

A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

- For example: `houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1]` contains `5` neighborhoods `[{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}]`.

Given an array `houses`, an `m x n` matrix `cost` and an integer `target` where:

- `houses[i]`: is the color of the house `i`, and `0` if the house is not painted yet.
- `cost[i][j]`: is the cost of paint the house `i` with the color `j + 1`.

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly target neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return `-1`.
