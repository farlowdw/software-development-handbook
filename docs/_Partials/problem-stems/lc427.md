Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0`'s and `1`'s only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the `grid`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. 
- `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```
class Node {
  public boolean val;
  public boolean isLeaf;
  public Node topLeft;
  public Node topRight;
  public Node bottomLeft;
  public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1`'s or all `0`'s) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
2. If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
3. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

**Quad-Tree format:**

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.
