You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values), and an integer `target`.

Suppose that `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

If `target` is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return `-1`.
