You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, and an integer `count`. A substring of `s` is said to be an **equal count substring** if, for each **unique** letter in the substring, it appears exactly `count` times in the substring.

Return the number of **equal count substrings** in `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
