You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the **value** of the `i`th card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards have the **same** value.

Return the **minimum** number of **consecutive** cards you have to pick up to have a pair of **matching** cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return `-1`.
