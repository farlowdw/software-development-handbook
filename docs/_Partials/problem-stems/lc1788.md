There is a garden of `n` flowers, and each flower has an integer beauty value. The flowers are arranged in a line. You are given an integer array `flowers` of size `n` and each `flowers[i]` represents the beauty of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> flower.

A garden is **valid** if it meets these conditions:

- The garden has at least two flowers.
- The first and the last flower of the garden have the same beauty value.

As the appointed gardener, you have the ability to **remove** any (possibly none) flowers from the garden. You want to remove flowers in a way that makes the remaining garden **valid**. The beauty of the garden is the sum of the beauty of all the remaining flowers.

Return the maximum possible beauty of some **valid** garden after you have removed any (possibly none) flowers.
