You are given a string `s` and an integer `t`, representing the number of **transformations** to perform. In one **transformation**, every character in `s` is replaced according to the following rules:

- If the character is `'z'`, replace it with the string `"ab"`.
- Otherwise, replace it with the **next** character in the alphabet. For example, `'a'` is replaced with `'b'`, `'b'` is replaced with `'c'`, and so on.

Return the **length** of the resulting string after **exactly** `t` transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
