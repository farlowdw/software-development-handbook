You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

From `nums1` two elements have been removed, and all other elements have been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable `x`.

As a result, `nums1` becomes **equal** to `nums2`. Two arrays are considered **equal** when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

Return the **minimum** possible integer `x` that achieves this equivalence.
