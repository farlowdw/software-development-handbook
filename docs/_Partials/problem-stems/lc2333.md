You are given two positive **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The **sum of squared difference** of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the **sum** of <code>(nums1[i] - nums2[i])<sup>2</sup></code> for each `0 <= i < n`.

You are also given two positive integers `k1` and `k2`. You can modify any of the elements of `nums1` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of `nums2` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k2` times.

Return the minimum **sum of squared difference** after modifying array `nums1` at most `k1` times and modifying array `nums2` at most `k2` times.

**Note:** You are allowed to modify the array elements to become **negative** integers.
