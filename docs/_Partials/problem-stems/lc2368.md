There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given an integer array `restricted` which represents **restricted** nodes.

Return the **maximum** number of nodes you can reach from node `0` without visiting a restricted node.

Note that node `0` will **not** be a restricted node.
