You are given a string `num` which represents a **positive** integer, and an integer `t`.

A number is called **zero-free** if *none* of its digits are `0`.

Return a string representing the **smallest zero-free** number greater than or equal to `num` such that the **product of its digits** is divisible by `t`. If no such number exists, return `"-1"`.
