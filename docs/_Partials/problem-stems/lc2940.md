You are given a **0-indexed** array `heights` of positive integers, where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i`th building.

If a person is in building `i`, they can move to any other building `j` if and only if `i < j` and `heights[i] < heights[j]`.

You are also given another array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>. On the `i`th query, Alice is in building <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> while Bob is in building <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is **the index of the leftmost building** where Alice and Bob can meet on the `i`th query. If Alice and Bob cannot move to a common building on query `i`, set `ans[i]` to `-1`.
