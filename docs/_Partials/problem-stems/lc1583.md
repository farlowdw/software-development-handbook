You are given a list of `preferences` for `n` friends, where `n` is always **even**.

For each person `i`, `preferences[i]` contains a list of friends **sorted** in the **order of preference**. In other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted by integers from `0` to `n-1`.

All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list `pairs`, where <code>pairs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> is paired with <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> is paired with <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>.

However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend `x` is unhappy if `x` is paired with `y` and there exists a friend `u` who is paired with `v` but:

- `x` prefers `u` over `y`, and
- `u` prefers `x` over `v`.

Return the number of unhappy friends.
