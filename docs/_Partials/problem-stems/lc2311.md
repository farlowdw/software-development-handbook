You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`.

Return the length of the **longest** subsequence of `s` that makes up a **binary** number less than or equal to `k`.

**Note:**

- The subsequence can contain **leading zeroes**.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to `0`.
- A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
