You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `jobs` and `workers` of **equal** length, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time needed to complete the `i`th job, and `workers[j]` is the amount of time the `j`th worker can work each day.

Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker, such that each worker completes **exactly** one job.

Return the **minimum** number of days needed to complete all the jobs after assignment.
