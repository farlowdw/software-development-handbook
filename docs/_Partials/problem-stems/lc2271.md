You are given a 2D integer array `tiles` where <code>tiles[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that every tile `j` in the range <code>l<sub>i</sub> <= j <= r<sub>i</sub></code> is colored white.

You are also given an integer `carpetLen`, the length of a single carpet that can be placed **anywhere**.

Return the **maximum** number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
