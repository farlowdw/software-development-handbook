There is an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

A node is **good** if all the subtrees rooted at its children have the same size.

Return the number of **good** nodes in the given tree.

A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.
