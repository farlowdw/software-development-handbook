This is an **interactive problem**.

You are given an array of **unique** strings `wordlist` where `wordlist[i]` is `6` letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as `secret`.

You may call `Master.guess(word)` to guess a word. The guessed word should have type `string` and must be from the original list with `6` lowercase letters.

This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the `secret` word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.

For each test case, you have exactly `10` guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made `10` or fewer calls to `Master.guess` and at least one of these guesses was `secret`, then you pass the test case.
