You are given an integer `num`. You will apply the following steps exactly **two** times:

- Pick a digit `x` (`0 <= x <= 9`).
- Pick another digit `y` (`0 <= y <= 9`). The digit `y` can be equal to `x`.
- Replace all the occurrences of `x` in the decimal representation of `num` by `y`.
- The new integer **cannot** have any leading zeros, also the new integer **cannot** be `0`.

Let `a` and `b` be the results of applying the operations to `num` the first and second times, respectively.

Return the max difference between `a` and `b`.
