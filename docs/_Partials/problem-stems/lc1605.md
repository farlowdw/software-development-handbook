You are given two arrays `rowSum` and `colSum` of non-negative integers where `rowSum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the `i`th row and `colSum[j]` is the sum of the elements of the `j`th column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.

Find any matrix of **non-negative** integers of size `rowSum.length x colSum.length` that satisfies the `rowSum` and `colSum` requirements.

Return a 2D array representing **any** matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that **at least one** matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.
