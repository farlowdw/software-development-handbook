You are given an integer array `digits`, where each element is a digit. The array may contain duplicates.

You need to find **all** the **unique** integers that follow the given requirements:

- The integer consists of the **concatenation** of **three** elements from `digits` in **any** arbitrary order.
- The integer does not have **leading zeros**.
- The integer is **even**.

For example, if the given `digits` were `[1, 2, 3]`, integers `132` and `312` follow the requirements.

Return a **sorted** array of the unique integers.
