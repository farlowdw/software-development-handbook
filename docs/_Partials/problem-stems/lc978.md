Given an integer array `arr`, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of `arr`.

A subarray is **turbulent** if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray.

More formally, a subarray `[arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]]` of `arr` is said to be turbulent if and only if:

- For `i <= k < j`:
  + `arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd, and
  + `arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even.
- Or, for `i <= k < j`:
  + `arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even, and
  + `arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd.
