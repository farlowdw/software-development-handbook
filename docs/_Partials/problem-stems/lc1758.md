You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and '`1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make `s` alternating.
