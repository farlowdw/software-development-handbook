Create a class `ArrayWrapper` that accepts an array of integers in it's constructor. This class should have two features:

- When two instances of this class are added together with the `+` operator, the resulting value is the sum of all the elements in both arrays.
- When the `String()` function is called on the instance, it will return a comma separated string surrounded by brackets. For example, `[1,2,3]`.
