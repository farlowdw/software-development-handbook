**Table:** `Buses`

```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| bus_id       | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
```

- `bus_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the Leetcode station.
- There will be no two buses that arrive at the same time.

**Table:** `Passengers`

```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
```

- `passenger_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the Leetcode station.

Buses and passengers arrive at the Leetcode station. If a bus arrives at the station at a time <code>t<sub>bus</sub></code> and a passenger arrived at a time <code>t<sub>passenger</sub></code> where <code>t<sub>passenger</sub> <= t<sub>bus</sub></code> and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus.

Write an SQL query to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by `bus_id` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
