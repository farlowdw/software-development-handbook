You are given a **binary** string `s` representing a number `n` in its binary form.

You are also given an integer `k`.

An integer `x` is called **k-reducible** if performing the following operation **at most** `k` times reduces it to `1`:

- Replace `x` with the **count** of set bits in its binary representation.

For example, the binary representation of `6` is `"110"`. Applying the operation once reduces it to `2` (since `"110"` has two set bits). Applying the operation again to `2` (binary `"10"`) reduces it to `1` (since `"10"` has one set bit).

Return an integer denoting the number of positive integers **less** than `n` that are **k-reducible**.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
