You are given two string arrays `creators` and `ids`, and an integer array `views`, all of length `n`. The `i`th video on a platform was created by `creator[i]`, has an id of `ids[i]`, and has `views[i]` views.

The **popularity** of a creator is the **sum** of the number of views on **all** of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the **highest** popularity and the id of their **most** viewed video.

- If multiple creators have the highest popularity, find all of them.
- If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically **smallest** id.

Return a 2D array of strings `answer` where <code>answer[i] = [creator<sub>i</sub>, id<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that <code>creator<sub>i</sub></code> has the **highest** popularity and <code>id<sub>i</sub></code> is the id of their most popular video. The answer can be returned in any order.
