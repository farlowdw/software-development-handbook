You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you will:

- Take the two smallest integers `x` and `y` in `nums`.
- Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Add `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` anywhere in the array.

**Note** that you can only apply the described operation if `nums` contains at least two elements.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to `k`.
