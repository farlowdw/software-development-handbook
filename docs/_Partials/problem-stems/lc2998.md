You are given two positive integers `x` and `y`.

In one operation, you can do one of the four following operations:

1. Divide `x` by `11` if `x` is a multiple of `11`.
2. Divide `x` by `5` if `x` is a multiple of `5`.
3. Decrement `x` by `1`.
4. Increment `x` by `1`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `x` and `y` equal.
