You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `3 x 3` consisting only of characters `'B'` and `'W'`. Character `'W'` represents the white color, and character `'B'` represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of **at most one** cell so that the matrix has a `2 x 2` square where all cells are of the same color.

Return `true` if it is possible to create a `2 x 2` square of the same color, otherwise, return `false`.
