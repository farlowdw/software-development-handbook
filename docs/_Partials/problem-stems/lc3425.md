You are given an undirected tree rooted at node `0` with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, length<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with length <code>length<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the value at node `i`.

A **special path** is defined as a **downward** path from an ancestor node to a descendant node such that all the values of the nodes in that path are **unique**.

Note that a path may start and end at the same node.

Return an array `result` of size `2`, where `result[0]` is the **length** of the **longest** special path, and `result[1]` is the **minimum** number of nodes in all possible longest special paths.
