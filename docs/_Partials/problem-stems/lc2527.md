You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **effective value** of three indices `i`, `j`, and `k` is defined as `((nums[i] | nums[j]) & nums[k])`.

The **xor-beauty** of the array is the XORing of **the effective values of all the possible triplets** of indices `(i, j, k)` where `0 <= i, j, k < n`.

Return the xor-beauty of `nums`.

**Note** that:

- `val1 | val2` is bitwise OR of `val1` and `val2`.
- `val1 & val2` is bitwise AND of `val1` and `val2`.
