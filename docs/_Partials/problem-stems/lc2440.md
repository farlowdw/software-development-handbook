There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `i`th node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

You are allowed to **delete** some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the **value** of a component be the sum of **all** `nums[i]` for which node `i` is in the component.

Return the **maximum** number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value.
