You are given a **0-indexed** string `word` and an integer `k`.

At every second, you must perform the following operations:

- Remove the first `k` characters of `word`.
- Add any `k` characters to the end of `word`.

**Note** that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform **both** operations at every second.

Return the **minimum** time greater than zero required for `word` to revert to its **initial** state.
