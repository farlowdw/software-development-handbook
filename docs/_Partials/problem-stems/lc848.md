We have a string `S` of lowercase letters, and an integer array `shifts`.

Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). 

For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i+1` letters of `S`, `x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `S` are applied.
