Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'`s, empty slots are represented with `'.'`s. You may assume the following rules:

- You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
- Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` (1 row, N columns) or `Nx1` (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
- At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.
