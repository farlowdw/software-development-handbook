The **product sum** of two equal-length arrays `a` and `b` is equal to the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `0 <= i < a.length` (**0-indexed**).

For example, if `a = [1,2,3,4]` and `b = [5,2,3,1]`, the **product sum** would be `1*5 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*1 = 22`.

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`, return the **minimum product sum** if you are allowed to **rearrange** the **order** of the elements in `nums1`.
