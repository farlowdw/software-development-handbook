Creating clones of immutable objects with minor alterations can be a tedious process. Write a class `ImmutableHelper` that serves as a tool to help with this requirement. The constructor accepts an immutable object `obj` which will be a JSON object or array.

The class has a single method `produce` which accepts a function `mutator`. The function returns a copy of `obj` with those mutations applied.

`mutator` accepts a **proxied** version of `obj`. A user of this function can (appear to) mutate this object, but the original object `obj` is not actually being effected.

For example, a user could write code like this:

```js
const originalObj = {"x": 5};
const helper = new ImmutableHelper(originalObj);
const newObj = helper.produce((proxy) => {
  proxy.x = proxy.x + 1;
});
console.log(originalObj); // {"x": 5}
console.log(newObj); // {"x": 6}
```

Properties of the `mutator` function:

- It will always return `undefined`.
- It will never access keys that don't exist.
- It will never delete keys (`delete obj.key`)
- It will never call methods on a proxied object (`push`, `shift`, etc).
- It will never set keys to objects (`proxy.x = {}`)

**Note on how the solution will be tested:** the solution validator will only analyze differences between what was returned and the original `obj`. Doing a full comparison would be too computationally expensive.
