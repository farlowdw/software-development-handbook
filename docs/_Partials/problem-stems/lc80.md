Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most *twice* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```
