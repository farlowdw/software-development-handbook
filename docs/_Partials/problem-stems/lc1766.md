There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the **root** of the tree is node `0`.

To represent this tree, you are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `edges`. Each `nums[i]` represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code>node's value, and each <code>edges[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]</code> represents an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code> in the tree.

Two values `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

An ancestor of a node `i` is any other node on the shortest path from node `i` to the **root**. A node is **not** considered an ancestor of itself.

Return an array ans of size `n`, where `ans[i]` is the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are **coprime**, or `-1` if there is no such ancestor.
