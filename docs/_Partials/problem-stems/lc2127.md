A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of `n` employees, waiting to be invited. They have arranged for a large **circular** table, capable of seating **any number** of employees.

The employees are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each employee has a **favorite** person and they will attend the meeting **only** if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is **not** themself.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `favorite`, where `favorite[i]` denotes the favorite person of the `i`th employee, return the **maximum number of employees** that can be invited to the meeting.
