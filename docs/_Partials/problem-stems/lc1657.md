Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.
  + For example, <code>a<u>b</u>cd<u>e</u> -> a<u>e</u>cd<u>b</u></code>
- Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.
  + For example, <code><u>aa</u>c<u>abb</u> -> <u>bb</u>c<u>baa</u></code> (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are **close**, and `false` otherwise.
