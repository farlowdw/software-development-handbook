Your laptop keyboard is faulty, and whenever you type a character `'i'` on it, it reverses the string that you have written. Typing other characters works as expected.

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s`, and you type each character of `s` using your faulty keyboard.

Return the final string that will be present on your laptop screen.
