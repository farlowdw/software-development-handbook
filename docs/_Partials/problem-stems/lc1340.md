Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step you can jump from index `i` to index:

- `i + x` where: `i + x < arr.length` and `0 < x <= d`.
- `i - x` where: `i - x >= 0` and `0 < x <= d`.

In addition, you can only jump from index `i` to index `j` if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `arr[i] > arr[k]` for all indices `k` between `i` and `j` (More formally `min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)`).

You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indices you can visit.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
