Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:

- `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board `n`.
- `int move(int row, int col, int player)` Indicates that player with id `player` plays at the cell `(row, col)` of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.

**Follow up:** Could you do better than <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> per `move()` operation?
