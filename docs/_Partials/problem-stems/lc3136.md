A word is considered **valid** if:

- It contains a **minimum** of 3 characters.
- It consists of the digits 0-9, and the uppercase and lowercase English letters. (Not necessary to have all of them.)
- It includes **at least** one **vowel**.
- It includes **at least** one **consonant**.

You are given a string `word`.

Return `true` if `word` is valid, otherwise, return `false`.

**Notes:**

- `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, and their uppercases are **vowels**.
- A **consonant** is an English letter that is not a vowel.
