You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied).

You are then given stamps of size `stampHeight x stampWidth`. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given **restrictions** and **requirements**:

1. Cover all the **empty** cells.
2. Do not cover any of the **occupied** cells.
3. We can put as **many** stamps as we want.
4. Stamps can **overlap** with each other.
5. Stamps are not allowed to be **rotated**.
6. Stamps must stay completely **inside** the grid.

Return `true` if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return `false`.
