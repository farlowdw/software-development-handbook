A farmer has a **rectangular grid** of land with `m` rows and `n` columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either **fertile** (represented by a `1`) or **barren** (represented by a `0`). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.

A **pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:

1. The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than** `1` and all cells must be **fertile**.
2. The **apex** of a pyramid is the **topmost** cell of the pyramid. The **height** of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i <= r + h - 1` and `c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r)`.

An **inverse pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:

1. The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than** `1` and all cells must be **fertile**.
2. The **apex** of an inverse pyramid is the **bottommost** cell of the inverse pyramid. The **height** of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r - h + 1 <= i <= r` and `c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i)`.

Some examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid` representing the farmland, return the **total number** of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can be found in `grid`.
