There are `n` different online courses numbered from `1` to `n`. Each course has some duration (course length) `t` and closed on <code>d<sup>th</sup></code> day. A course should be taken **continuously** for `t` days and must be finished before or on the <code>d<sup>th</sup></code> day. You will start at the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> day.

Given `n` online courses represented by pairs `(t,d)`, your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.
