Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the `n`th lake, the `n`th lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is **full of water**, there will be a **flood**. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array `rains` where:

- `rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.
- `rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose **one lake** this day and **dry it**.

Return an array `ans` where:

- `ans.length == rains.length`
- `ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0`
- `ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the `i`th day if `rains[i] == 0`

If there are multiple valid answers return **any** of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return **an empty array**.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)
