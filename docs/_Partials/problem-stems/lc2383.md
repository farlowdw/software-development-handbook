You are entering a competition, and are given two **positive** integers `initialEnergy` and `initialExperience` denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.

You are also given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `energy` and `experience`, both of length `n`.

You will face `n` opponents **in order**. The energy and experience of the `i`th opponent is denoted by `energy[i]` and `experience[i]` respectively. When you face an opponent, you need to have both **strictly** greater experience and energy to defeat them and move to the next opponent if available.

Defeating the `i`th opponent **increases** your experience by `experience[i]`, but **decreases** your energy by `energy[i]`.

Before starting the competition, you can train for some number of hours. After each hour of training, you can **either** choose to increase your initial experience by one, or increase your initial energy by one.

Return the **minimum** number of training hours required to defeat all `n` opponents.
