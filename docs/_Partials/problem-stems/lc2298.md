**Table:** `Tasks`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| task_id     | int  |
| assignee_id | int  |
| submit_date | date |
+-------------+------+
```

- `task_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table contains the ID of a task, the id of the assignee, and the submission date.

Write an SQL query to report:

- the number of the tasks that were submitted during the weekend (Saturday, Sunday) as `weekend_cnt`, and
- the number of the tasks that were submitted during the working days as `working_cnt`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is shown in the following example.
