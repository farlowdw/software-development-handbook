A delivery company wants to build a new service centre in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new centre in a position such that **the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum.**

Given an array `positions` where <code>positions[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> is the position of the `i`th customer on the map, return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service centre <code>[x<sub>centre</sub>, y<sub>centre</sub>]</code> such that the following formula is minimized:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sqrt{(x_{	ext{centre}} - x_i)^2 + (y_{	ext{centre}} - y_i)^2}
$$
