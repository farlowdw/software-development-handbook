You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length. Every second, for all indices `0 <= i < nums1.length`, value of `nums1[i]` is incremented by `nums2[i]`. **After** this is done, you can do the following operation:

- Choose an index `0 <= i < nums1.length` and make `nums1[i] = 0`.

You are also given an integer `x`.

Return the **minimum** time in which you can make the sum of all elements of `nums1` to be **less than or equal** to `x`, or `-1` if this is not possible.
