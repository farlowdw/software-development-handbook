You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.

For each subarray of `nums`, you can apply **up to** `k` operations on it. In each operation, you increment any element of the subarray by `1`.

**Note** that each subarray is considered independently, meaning changes made to one subarray do not persist to another.

Return the number of subarrays that you can make **non-decreasing** ​​​​​after performing at most `k` operations.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element, if it exists.
