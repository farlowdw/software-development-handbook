A [binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

For each internal node with operator `o`, the [infix expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) that it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.

You are given a string `s`, an **infix expression** containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.

Return any valid **binary expression tree**, which its [in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR)) reproduces `s` after omitting the parenthesis from it (see examples below).

**Please note that order of operations applies in** `s`. That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

Operands must also appear in the **same order** in both `s` and the in-order traversal of the tree.
