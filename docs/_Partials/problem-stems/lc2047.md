A sentence consists of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), digits (`'0'` to `'9'`), hyphens (`'-'`), punctuation marks (`'!'`, `'.'`, and `','`), and spaces (`' '`) only. Each sentence can be broken down into **one or more tokens** separated by one or more spaces `' '`.

A token is a valid word if:

- It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens, and/or punctuation (**no** digits).
- There is **at most one** hyphen `'-'`. If present, it should be surrounded by lowercase characters (`"a-b"` is valid, but `"-ab"` and `"ab-"` are not valid).
- There is **at most one** punctuation mark. If present, it should be at the **end** of the token.

Examples of valid words include `"a-b."`, `"afad"`, `"ba-c"`, `"a!"`, and `"!"`.

Given a string `sentence`, return the **number** of valid words in `sentence`.
