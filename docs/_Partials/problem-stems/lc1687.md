You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a **limit** on the **number of boxes** and the **total weight** that it can carry.

You are given an array `boxes`, where <code>boxes[i] = [ports<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code>, and three integers `portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, and `maxWeight`.

- <code>ports<sub>i</sub></code> is the port where you need to deliver the `i`th box and <code>weights<sub>i</sub></code> is the weight of the `i`th box.
- `portsCount` is the number of ports.
- `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered **in the order they are given**. The ship will follow these steps:

- The ship will take some number of boxes from the `boxes` queue, not violating the `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` constraints.
- For each loaded box **in order**, the ship will make a **trip** to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no **trip** is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
- The ship then makes a return **trip** to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return the **minimum** number of **trips** the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.
