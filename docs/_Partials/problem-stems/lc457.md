You are playing a game involving a **circular** array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

- If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward**, and
- If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward**.

Since the array is **circular**, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A **cycle** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

- Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
- Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive** or **all negative**.
- `k > 1`

Return `true` if there is a **cycle** in `nums`, or `false` otherwise.
