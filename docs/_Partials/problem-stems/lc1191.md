Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, modify the array by repeating it `k` times.

For example, if `arr = [1, 2]` and `k = 3` then the modified array will be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.

Return the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array. Note that the length of the sub-array can be `0` and its sum in that case is `0`.

As the answer can be very large, return the answer **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
