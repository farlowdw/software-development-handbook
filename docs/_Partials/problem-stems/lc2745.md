You are given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`.

You have `x` strings equal to `"AA"`, `y` strings equal to `"BB"`, and `z` strings equal to `"AB"`. You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concactenate them in some order to form a new string. This new string must not contain `"AAA"` or `"BBB"` as a substring.

Return the maximum possible length of the new string.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.
