There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first. (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)
