Design a max stack data structure that supports the stack operations and supports finding the stack's maximum element.

Implement the `MaxStack` class:

- `MaxStack()` Initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int x)` Pushes element `x` onto the stack.
- `int pop()` Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
- `int top()` Gets the element on the top of the stack without removing it.
- `int peekMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack without removing it.
- `int popMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack and removes it. If there is more than one maximum element, only remove the **top-most** one.
