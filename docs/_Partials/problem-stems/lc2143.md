You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`.

A range `[l, r]` (**inclusive**) where `0 <= l <= r < n` is **balanced** if:

- For every `i` in the range `[l, r]`, you pick either `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`.
- The sum of the numbers you pick from `nums1` equals to the sum of the numbers you pick from `nums2` (the sum is considered to be `0` if you pick no numbers from an array).

Two **balanced** ranges from <code>[l<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>]</code> and <code>[l<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>]</code> are considered to be **different** if at least one of the following is true:

- <code>l<sub>1</sub> != l<sub>2</sub></code>
- <code>r<sub>1</sub> != r<sub>2</sub></code>
- `nums1[i]` is picked in the first range, and `nums2[i]` is picked in the second range or **vice versa** for at least one `i`.

Return the number of **different** ranges that are balanced. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
