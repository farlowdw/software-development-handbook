Given a circle represented as (`radius`, `x_center`, `y_center`) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`), where (`x1`, `y1`) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (`x2`, `y2`) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return True if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return False.

In other words, check if there are **any** point (`xi`, `yi`) such that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.
