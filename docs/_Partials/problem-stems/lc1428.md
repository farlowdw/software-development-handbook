(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)

A **row-sorted binary matrix** means that all elements are `0` or `1` and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a **row-sorted binary matrix** `binaryMatrix`, return the index (0-indexed) of the **leftmost column** with a `1` in it. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

**You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.** You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:

- `BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).
- `BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows x cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix `mat`. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.
