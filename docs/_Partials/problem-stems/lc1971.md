There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and vertex <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex `start` to vertex `end`.

Given `edges` and the integers `n`, `start`, and `end`, return `true` if there is a **valid path** from `start` to `end`, or `false` otherwise.
