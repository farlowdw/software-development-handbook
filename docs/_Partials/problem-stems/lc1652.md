You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a **circular** array `code` of length of `n` and a key `k`.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced **simultaneously**.

- If `k > 0`, replace the `i`th number with the sum of the **next** `k` numbers.
- If `k < 0`, replace the `i`th number with the sum of the **previous** `k` numbers.
- If `k == 0`, replace the `i`th number with `0`.

As `code` is circular, the next element of `code[n-1]` is `code[0]`, and the previous element of `code[0]` is `code[n-1]`.

Given the **circular** array `code` and an integer key `k`, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
