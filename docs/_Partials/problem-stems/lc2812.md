You are given a **0-indexed** 2D matrix `grid` of size `n x n`, where `(r, c)` represents:

- A cell containing a thief if `grid[r][c] = 1`
- An empty cell if `grid[r][c] = 0`

You are initially positioned at cell `(0, 0)`. In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.

The **safeness factor** of a path on the grid is defined as the **minimum** manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.

Return the **maximum safeness factor** of all paths leading to cell `(n - 1, n - 1)`.

An **adjacent** cell of cell `(r, c)`, is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)` and `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.

The **Manhattan distance** between two cells `(a, b)` and `(x, y)` is equal to `|a - x| + |b - y|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.
