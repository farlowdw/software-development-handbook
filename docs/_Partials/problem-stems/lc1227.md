`n` passengers board an airplane with exactly `n` seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of passengers will:

- Take their own seat if it is still available, 
- Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied 

What is the probability that the `n`th person can get his own seat?
