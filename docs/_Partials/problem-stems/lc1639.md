You are given a list of strings of the **same length** `words` and a string `target`.

Your task is to form `target` using the given `words` under the following rules:

- `target` should be formed from left to right.
- To form the `i`th character (**0-indexed**) of `target`, you can choose the `k`th character of the `j`th string in words if `target[i] = words[j][k]`.
- Once you use the `k`th character of the `j`th string of `words`, you **can no longer** use the `x`th character of any string in `words` where `x <= k`. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index `k` become unusuable for every string.
- Repeat the process until you form the string `target`.

**Notice** that you can use **multiple characters** from the **same string** in `words` provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form `target` from `words`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
