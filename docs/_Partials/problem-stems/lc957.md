There are `8` prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

**Note** that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.

You are given an integer array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `i`th cell is occupied and `cells[i] == 0` if the `i`th cell is vacant, and you are given an integer `n`.

Return the state of the prison after `n` days (i.e., `n` such changes described above).
