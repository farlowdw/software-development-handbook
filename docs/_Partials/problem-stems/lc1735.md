You are given a 2D integer array, `queries`. For each `queries[i]`, where <code>queries[i] = [n<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code>, find the number of different ways you can place positive integers into an array of size <code>n<sub>i</sub></code> such that the product of the integers is <code>k<sub>i</sub></code>. As the number of ways may be too large, the answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query is the number of ways **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer.length == queries.length`, and `answer[i]` is the answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query.
