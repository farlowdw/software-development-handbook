An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where <code>edgeList[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, dis<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with distance <code>dis<sub>i</sub></code>. Note that there may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

Given an array `queries`, where <code>queries[j] = [p<sub>j</sub>, q<sub>j</sub>, limit<sub>j</sub>]</code>, your task is to determine for each `queries[j]` whether there is a path between <code>p<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>q<sub>j</sub></code> such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than <code>limit<sub>j</sub></code>.

Return a **boolean array** `answer`, where `answer.length == queries.length` and the `j`th value of answer is `true` if there is a path for `queries[j]` is `true`, and `false` otherwise.
