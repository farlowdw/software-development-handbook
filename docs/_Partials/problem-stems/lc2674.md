Given a **circular linked list** `list` of positive integers, your task is to split it into 2 **circular linked lists** so that the first one contains the **first half** of the nodes in `list` (exactly `ceil(list.length / 2)` nodes) in the same order they appeared in `list`, and the second one contains **the rest** of the nodes in `list` in the same order they appeared in `list`.

Return an array answer of length 2 in which the first element is a **circular linked list** representing the **first half** and the second element is a **circular linked list** representing the **second half**.

A **circular linked list** is a normal linked list with the only difference being that the last node's next node, is the first node.
