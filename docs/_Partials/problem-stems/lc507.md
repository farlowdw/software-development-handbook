A [perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) is a **positive integer** that is equal to the sum of its **positive divisors**, excluding the number itself. A **divisor** of an integer `x` is an integer that can divide `x` evenly.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is a perfect number, otherwise return `false`.
