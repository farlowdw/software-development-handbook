You are given a string `text` of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that `text` **contains at least one word**.

Rearrange the spaces so that there is an **equal** number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is **maximized**. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the **extra spaces at the end**, meaning the returned string should be the same length as `text`.

Return the string after rearranging the spaces.
