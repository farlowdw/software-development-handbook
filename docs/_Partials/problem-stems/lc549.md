Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the longest consecutive path in the tree.

This path can be either increasing or decreasing.

- For example, `[1,2,3,4]` and `[4,3,2,1]` are both considered valid, but the path `[1,2,4,3]` is not valid.

On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.
