You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of zeroes and ones.

A substring of `s` is considered balanced if **all zeroes are before ones** and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring. Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.

Return the length of the longest balanced substring of `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
