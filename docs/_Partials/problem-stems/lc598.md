You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and an array of operations `ops`, where <code>ops[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> means `M[x][y]` should be incremented by one for all <code>0 <= x < a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>0 <= y &lt; b<sub>i</sub></code>.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
