You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `3 * 3`, representing the number of stones in each cell. The grid contains exactly `9` stones, and there can be **multiple** stones in a single cell.

In one move, you can move a single stone from its current cell to any other cell if the two cells share a side.

Return the **minimum number of moves** required to place one stone in each cell.
