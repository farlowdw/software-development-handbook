You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to `n` units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

- You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
- If box `x` is placed on top of the box `y`, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box `y` **must** either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.

Given an integer `n`, return the **minimum** possible number of boxes touching the floor.
