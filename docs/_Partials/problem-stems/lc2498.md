You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `stones` sorted in **strictly increasing order** representing the positions of stones in a river.

A frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone **at most once**.

The **length** of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.

- More formally, if the frog is at `stones[i]` and is jumping to `stones[j]`, the length of the jump is `|stones[i] - stones[j]|`.

The **cost** of a path is the **maximum length of a jump** among all jumps in the path.

Return the **minimum** cost of a path for the frog.
