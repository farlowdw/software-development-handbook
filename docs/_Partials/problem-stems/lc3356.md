You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>, val<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

Each `queries[i]` represents the following action on `nums`:

- Decrement the value at each index in the range <code>[l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> in `nums` by **at most** <code>val<sub>i</sub></code>.
- The amount by which each value is decremented can be chosen **independently** for each index.

A **Zero Array** is an array with all its elements equal to `0`.

Return the **minimum** possible **non-negative** value of `k`, such that after processing the first `k` queries in **sequence**, `nums` becomes a **Zero Array**. If no such `k` exists, return `-1`.
