Write a function `expect` that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.

- `toBe(val)` accepts another value and returns `true` if the two values `===` each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error `"Not Equal"`.
- `notToBe(val)` accepts another value and returns `true` if the two values `!==` each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error `"Equal"`.
