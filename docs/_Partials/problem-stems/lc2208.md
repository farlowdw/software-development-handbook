You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose **any** number from `nums` and reduce it to **exactly** half the number. (Note that you may choose this reduced number in future operations.)

Return the **minimum** number of operations to reduce the sum of `nums` by **at least** half.
