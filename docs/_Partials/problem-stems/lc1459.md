**Table:** `Points`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| x_value       | int     |
| y_value       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each point is represented as a 2D Dimensional `(x_value, y_value)`.

Write an SQL query to report of all possible rectangles which can be formed by any two points of the table. 

Each row in the result contains three columns `(p1, p2, area)` where:

- **p1** and **p2** are the id of two opposite corners of a rectangle and `p1 < p2`.
- Area of this rectangle is represented by the column **area**.

Report the query in descending order by area in case of tie in ascending order by `p1` and `p2`.

Points table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| id       | x_value     | y_value     |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 1        | 2           | 8           |
| 2        | 4           | 7           |
| 3        | 2           | 10          |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| p1       | p2          | area        |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 2        | 3           | 6           |
| 1        | 2           | 2           |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
```

- `p1` should be less than `p2` and area greater than `0`.
- `p1 = 1` and `p2 = 2`, has an area equal to `|2-4| * |8-7| = 2`.
- `p1 = 2` and `p2 = 3`, has an area equal to `|4-2| * |7-10| = 6`.
- `p1 = 1` and `p2 = 3` It's not possible because the rectangle has an area equal to `0`.
