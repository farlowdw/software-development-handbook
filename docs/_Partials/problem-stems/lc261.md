You have a graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer `n` and a list of `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.

Return `true` if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and `false` otherwise.
