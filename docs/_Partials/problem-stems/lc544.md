During the NBA playoffs, we always arrange the rather strong team to play with the rather weak team, like make the rank `1` team play with the rank `n`th team, which is a good strategy to make the contest more interesting. Now, you're given `n` teams, you need to output their **final** contest matches in the form of a string.

The `n` teams are given in the form of positive integers from `1` to `n`, which represents their initial rank. (Rank `1` is the strongest team and Rank `n` is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses (`'('`, `')'`) and commas(`','`) to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses(`'('` , `')'`) for pairing and commas(`','`) for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.
