You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and two integers `x` and `y`. In one operation, you must choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length` and perform the following:

- Decrement `nums[i]` by `x`.
- Decrement values by `y` at all indices except the `i`th one.

Return the minimum number of operations to make all the integers in `nums` **less than or equal to zero**.
