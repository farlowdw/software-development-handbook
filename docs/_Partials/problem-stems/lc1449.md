Given an array of integers `cost` and an integer `target`. Return the **maximum** integer you can paint under the following rules:

- The cost of painting a digit (i+1) is given by `cost[i]` (0 indexed).
- The total cost used must be equal to `target`.
- Integer does not have digits `0`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it as string.

If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return `"0"`.
