You are given a string `s`.

Consider performing the following operation until `s` becomes **empty**:

- For **every** alphabet character from `'a'` to `'z'`, remove the **first** occurrence of that character in `s` (if it exists).

For example, let initially `s = "aabcbbca"`. We do the following operations:

- Remove the underlined characters <code>s = "<u>a</u>a<u>bc</u>bbca"</code>. The resulting string is `s = "abbca"`.
- Remove the underlined characters <code>s = "<u>ab</u>b<u>c</u>a"</code>. The resulting string is `s = "ba"`.
- Remove the underlined characters <code>s = "<u>ba</u>"</code>. The resulting string is `s = ""`.

Return the value of the string `s` right **before** applying the **last** operation. In the example above, answer is `"ba"`.
