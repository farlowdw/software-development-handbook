On an **8x8** chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.

Given an array of integer coordinates `queens` that represents the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates `king` that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the King.
