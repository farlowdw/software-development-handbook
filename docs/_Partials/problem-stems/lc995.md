In an array `A` containing only `0`s and `1`s, a `K`-bit flip consists of choosing a (contiguous) subarray of length `K` and simultaneously changing every `0` in the subarray to `1`, and every `1` in the subarray to `0`.

Return the minimum number of `K`-bit flips required so that there is no `0` in the array.  If it is not possible, return `-1`.
