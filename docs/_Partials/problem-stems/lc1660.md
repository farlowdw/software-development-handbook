You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is **exactly one** invalid node where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the **same depth** but to the **invalid node's right**.

Given the root of the binary tree with this defect, `root`, return the root of the binary tree after **removing** this invalid node **and every node underneath it** (minus the node it incorrectly points to).

**Custom testing:**

The test input is read as 3 lines:

- `TreeNode root`
- `int fromNode` (**not available to** `correctBinaryTree`)
- `int toNode` (**not available to** `correctBinaryTree`)

After the binary tree rooted at `root` is parsed, the `TreeNode` with value of `fromNode` will have its right child pointer pointing to the `TreeNode` with a value of `toNode`. Then, `root` is passed to `correctBinaryTree`.
