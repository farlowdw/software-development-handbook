A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node represents a term in a polynomial expression.

Each node has three attributes:

- `coefficient`: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The coefficient of the term <code>9x<sup>4</sup></code> is `9`.
- `power`: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term <code>9x<sup>4</sup></code> is `4`.
- `next`: a pointer to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node of the list.

For example, the polynomial <code>5x<sup>3</sup> + 4x - 7</code> is represented by the polynomial linked list illustrated below:

</p>

The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in **strictly** descending order by its `power` value. Also, terms with a `coefficient` of `0` are omitted.

Given two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, add the polynomials together and return the head of the sum of the polynomials.

**`PolyNode` format:**

The input/output format is as a list of `n` nodes, where each node is represented as its `[coefficient, power]`. For example, the polynomial <code>5x<sup>3</sup> + 4x - 7</code> would be represented as: `[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]`.
