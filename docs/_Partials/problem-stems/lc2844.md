You are given a **0-indexed** string `num` representing a non-negative integer.

In one operation, you can pick any digit of `num` and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of `num`, `num` becomes `0`.

Return the **minimum number of operations** required to make `num` special.

An integer `x` is considered **special** if it is divisible by `25`.
