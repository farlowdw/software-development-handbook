You are given a 2D integer array `items` where <code>items[i] = [price<sub>i</sub>, beauty<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the **price** and **beauty** of an item respectively.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `queries`. For each `queries[j]`, you want to determine the **maximum beauty** of an item whose **price** is **less than or equal** to `queries[j]`. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is `0`.

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries` where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j`th query.
