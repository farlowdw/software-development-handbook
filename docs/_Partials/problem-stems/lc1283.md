Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the **smallest** `divisor` such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: `7/3 = 3` and `10/2 = 5`).

It is guaranteed that there will be an answer.
