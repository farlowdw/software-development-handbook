You are given a tree rooted at node `0` that consists of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by an array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

We make the following changes on the tree **one** time **simultaneously** for all nodes `x` from `1` to `n - 1`:

- Find the **closest** node `y` to node `x` such that `y` is an ancestor of `x`, and `s[x] == s[y]`.
- If node `y` does not exist, do nothing.
- Otherwise, **remove** the edge between `x` and its current parent and make node `y` the new parent of `x` by adding an edge between them.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **size** of the subtree rooted at node `i` in the **final** tree.
