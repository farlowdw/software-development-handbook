There is a number `n` that you have to find.

There is also a pre-defined API `int commonSetBits(int num)`, which returns the number of bits where both `n` and `num` are `1` in that position of their binary representation. In other words, it returns the number of set bits in `n & num`, where `&` is the bitwise `AND` operator.

Return the number `n`.
