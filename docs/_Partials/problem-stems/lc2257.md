You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a **0-indexed** `m x n` grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays `guards` and `walls` where <code>guards[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>] and walls[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]</code> represent the positions of the `i`th guard and `j`th wall respectively.

A guard can see **every** cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless **obstructed** by a wall or another guard. A cell is **guarded** if there is **at least** one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are **not guarded**.
