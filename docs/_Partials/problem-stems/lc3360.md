Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with Alice going first.

- Alice starts by removing **exactly** 10 stones on her first turn.
- For each subsequent turn, each player removes **exactly** 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if Alice wins the game and `false` otherwise.
