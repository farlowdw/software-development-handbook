A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range `[1, k]` and there are no leading zeros in the array.

Given the string `s` and the integer `k`. There can be multiple ways to restore the array.

Return the number of possible array that can be printed as a string `s` using the mentioned program.

The number of ways could be very large so return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
