Given an `n x n` grid containing only values `0` and `1`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.
