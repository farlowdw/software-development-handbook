You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. Find `p` pairs of indices of `nums` such that the **maximum** difference amongst all the pairs is **minimized**. Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the `p` pairs.

Note that for a pair of elements at the index `i` and `j`, the difference of this pair is `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`, where `|x|` represents the absolute value of `x`.

Return the **minimum maximum** difference among all `p` pairs. We define the maximum of an empty set to be zero.
