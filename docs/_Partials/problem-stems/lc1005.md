Given an array `A` of integers, we **must** modify the array in the following way: we choose an `i` and replace `A[i]` with `-A[i]`, and we repeat this process `K` times in total.  (We may choose the same index `i` multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.
