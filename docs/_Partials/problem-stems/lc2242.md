There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `scores` of length `n` where `scores[i]` denotes the score of node `i`. You are also given a 2D integer array edges where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub></code>.

A node sequence is **valid** if it meets the following conditions:

- There is an edge connecting every pair of **adjacent** nodes in the sequence.
- No node appears more than once in the sequence.

The score of a node sequence is defined as the **sum** of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.

Return the **maximum score** of a valid node sequence with a length of `4`. If no such sequence exists, return `-1`.
