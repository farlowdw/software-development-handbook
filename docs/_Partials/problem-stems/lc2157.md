You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words`. Each string consists of **lowercase English letters** only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of `words`.

Two strings `s1` and `s2` are said to be **connected** if the set of letters of `s2` can be obtained from the set of letters of `s1` by any **one** of the following operations:

- Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of `s1`.
- Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of `s1`.
- Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of `s1` with any letter, **including** itself.

The array `words` can be divided into one or more non-intersecting **groups**. A string belongs to a group if any **one** of the following is true:

- It is connected to **at least one** other string of the group.
- It is the **only** string present in the group.

Note that the strings in `words` should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.

Return an array `ans` of size `2` where:

- `ans[0]` is the **total number** of groups `words` can be divided into, and
- `ans[1]` is the **size of the largest** group.
