For a binary tree **T**, we can define a **flip operation** as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree **X** is flip equivalent to a binary tree **Y** if and only if we can make **X** equal to **Y** after some number of flip operations.

Given the roots of two binary trees `root1` and `root2`, return `true` if the two trees are flip equivelent or `false` otherwise.
