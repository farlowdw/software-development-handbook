The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given `n` and `k`, return the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> permutation sequence.
