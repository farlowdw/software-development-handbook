You are given a string `num` consisting of digits only.

Return the **largest palindromic** integer (in the form of a string) that can be formed using digits taken from `num`. It should not contain **leading zeroes**.

**Notes:**

- You do **not** need to use all the digits of `num`, but you must use **at least** one digit.
- The digits can be reordered.
