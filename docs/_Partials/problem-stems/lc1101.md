In a social group, there are `N` people, with unique integer ids from `0` to `N-1`.

We have a list of `logs`, where each `logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B]` contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if `A` is friends with `B`, then `B` is friends with `A`.

Let's say that person `A` is acquainted with person `B` if `A` is friends with `B`, or `A` is a friend of someone acquainted with `B`.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return `-1` if there is no such earliest time.
