There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for `n` days. On the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, the tree grows `apples[i]` apples that will rot after `days[i]` days, that is on day `i + days[i]` the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by `apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0`.

You decided to eat **at most** one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.

Given two integer arrays `days` and `apples` of length `n`, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.
