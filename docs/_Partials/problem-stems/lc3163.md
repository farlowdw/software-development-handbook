Given a string `word`, compress it using the following algorithm:

- Begin with an empty string `comp`. While `word` is **not** empty, use the following operation:
  + Remove a maximum length prefix of `word` made of a single character `c` repeating **at most** 9 times.
  + Append the length of the prefix followed by `c` to `comp`.

Return the string `comp`.
