You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers. You are also given a 2D array `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [pos<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

For query `i`, we first set <code>nums[pos<sub>i</sub>]</code> equal to <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>, then we calculate the answer to query `i` which is the **maximum** sum of a subsequence of `nums` where **no two adjacent elements are selected**.

Return the sum of the answers to all queries.

Since the final answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
