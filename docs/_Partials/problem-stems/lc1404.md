Given a number `s` in their binary representation. Return the number of steps to reduce it to `1` under the following rules:

- If the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`.
- If the current number is odd, you have to add `1` to it.

It's guaranteed that you can always reach to one for all testcases.
