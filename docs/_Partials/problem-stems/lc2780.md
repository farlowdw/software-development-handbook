An element `x` of an integer array `arr` of length `m` is **dominant** if `freq(x) * 2 > m`, where `freq(x)` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `arr`. Note that this definition implies that `arr` can have **at most one** dominant element.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` with one dominant element.

You can split `nums` at an index `i` into two arrays `nums[0, ..., i]` and `nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1]`, but the split is only **valid** if:

- `0 <= i < n - 1`
- `nums[0, ..., i]`, and `nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1]` have the same dominant element.

Here, `nums[i, ..., j]` denotes the subarray of `nums` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`, both ends being inclusive. Particularly, if `j < i` then `nums[i, ..., j]` denotes an empty subarray.

Return the **minimum** index of a **valid split**. If no valid split exists, return `-1`.
