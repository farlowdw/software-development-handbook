You are given an array of network towers `towers` and an integer `radius`, where <code>towers[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, q<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the `i`th network tower with location <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and quality factor <code>q<sub>i</sub></code>. All the coordinates are **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane, and the distance between two coordinates is the **Euclidean distance**.

The integer `radius` denotes the **maximum distance** in which the tower is **reachable**. The tower is **reachable** if the distance is less than or equal to `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is **not reachable**.

The signal quality of the `i`th tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula <code>⌊q<sub>i</sub> / (1 + d)⌋</code>, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The **network quality** at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the **reachable** towers.

Return the integral coordinate where the **network quality** is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same **network quality**, return the lexicographically minimum coordinate.

**Note:**

- A coordinate `(x1, y1)` is lexicographically smaller than `(x2, y2)` if either `x1 < x2` or `x1 == x2` and `y1 < y2`.
- <code>⌊val⌋</code> is the greatest integer less than or equal to `val` (the floor function).
