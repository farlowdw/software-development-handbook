You are given two non-negative integer arrays `price` and `tastiness`, both arrays have the same length `n`. You are also given two non-negative integers `maxAmount` and `maxCoupons`.

For every integer `i` in range `[0, n - 1]`:

- `price[i]` describes the price of `i`th fruit.
- `tastiness[i]` describes the tastiness of `i`th fruit.

You want to purchase some fruits such that total tastiness is maximized and the total price does not exceed `maxAmount`.

Additionally, you can use a coupon to purchase fruit for **half of its price** (rounded down to the closest integer). You can use at most `maxCoupons` of such coupons.

Return the maximum total tastiness that can be purchased.

**Note that:**

- You can purchase each fruit at most once.
- You can use coupons on some fruit at most once.
