You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

We call two integers `x` and `y` in this problem **almost equal** if both integers can become equal after performing the following operation **at most once**:

- Choose **either** `x` or `y` and swap any two digits within the chosen number.

Return the number of indices `i` and `j` in `nums` where `i < j` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are **almost equal**.

**Note** that it is allowed for an integer to have leading zeros after performing an operation.
