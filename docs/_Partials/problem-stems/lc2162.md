A generic microwave supports cooking times for:

- at least `1` second.
- at most `99` minutes and `99` seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push **at most four digits**. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by **prepending zeroes**. It interprets the **first** two digits as the minutes and the **last** two digits as the seconds. It then **adds** them up as the cooking time. For example,

- You push `9` `5` `4` (three digits). It is normalized as `0954` and interpreted as `9` minutes and `54` seconds.
- You push `0` `0` `0` `8` (four digits). It is interpreted as `0` minutes and `8` seconds.
- You push `8` `0` `9` `0`. It is interpreted as `80` minutes and `90` seconds.
- You push `8` `1` `3` `0`. It is interpreted as `81` minutes and `30` seconds.

You are given integers `startAt`, `moveCost`, `pushCost`, and `targetSeconds`. **Initially**, your finger is on the digit `startAt`. Moving the finger above **any specific digit** costs `moveCost` units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger **once** costs `pushCost` units of fatigue.

There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for `targetSeconds` seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.

Return the **minimum cost** to set `targetSeconds` seconds of cooking time.

Remember that one minute consists of `60` seconds.
