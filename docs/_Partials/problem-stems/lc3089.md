**Table:** `Posts`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| post_id     | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
| post_date   | date    |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `post_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table contains `post_id`, `user_id`, and `post_date`.

Write a solution to find users who demonstrate **bursty behavior** in their posting patterns during February `2024`. **Bursty behavior** is defined as **any** period of **7 consecutive** days where a user's posting frequency is **at least twice** to their **average** weekly posting frequency for February `2024`.

**Note:** Only include the dates from February `1` to February `28` in your analysis, which means you should count February as having exactly `4` weeks.

Return the result table orderd by `user_id` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

<summary> Example 1</summary>

- **Input:** 

```
+---------+---------+------------+
| post_id | user_id | post_date  |
+---------+---------+------------+
| 1       | 1       | 2024-02-27 |
| 2       | 5       | 2024-02-06 |
| 3       | 3       | 2024-02-25 |
| 4       | 3       | 2024-02-14 |
| 5       | 3       | 2024-02-06 |
| 6       | 2       | 2024-02-25 |
+---------+---------+------------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+---------+----------------+------------------+
| user_id | max_7day_posts | avg_weekly_posts |
+---------+----------------+------------------+
| 1       | 1              | 0.2500           |
| 2       | 1              | 0.2500           |
| 5       | 1              | 0.2500           |
+---------+----------------+------------------+
```

- **Explanation:** 
  + User `1`: Made only `1` post in February, resulting in an average of `0.25` posts per week and a max of `1` post in any 7-day period.
  + User `2`: Also made just `1` post, with the same average and max 7-day posting frequency as User `1`.
  + User `5`: Like Users `1` and `2`, User `5` made only `1` post throughout February, leading to the same average and max 7-day posting metrics.
  + User `3`: Although User 3 made more posts than the others (`3` posts), they did not reach twice the average weekly posts in their consecutive 7-day window, so they are not listed in the output.

  Note: Output table is ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.
