Given an integer array `instructions`, you are asked to create a sorted array from the elements in `instructions`. You start with an empty container `nums`. For each element from **left to right** in `instructions`, insert it into `nums`. The **cost** of each insertion is the **minimum** of the following:

- The number of elements currently in `nums` that are **strictly less than** `instructions[i]`.
- The number of elements currently in `nums` that are **strictly greater than** `instructions[i]`.

For example, if inserting element `3` into `nums = [1,2,3,5]`, the cost of insertion is `min(2, 1)` (elements `1` and `2` are less than `3`, element `5` is greater than `3`) and `nums` will become `[1,2,3,3,5]`.

Return the **total cost** to insert all elements from `instructions` into `nums`. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
