**Table:** `Files`

| Column Name | Type    |

| file_name   | varchar |
| content     | text    |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `file_name` is the primary key of this table. 
- Each row contains `file_name` and the `content` of that file.

Write an SQL query to find the number of occurrences of the words `'bull'` and `'bear'` as a **standalone word**, disregarding any instances where it appears as part of another word (e.g. 'bullet' and 'bears' will **not** be considered).

Return the word `'bull'` and `'bear'` along with the corresponding number of occurrences in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
