A **substring** is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

A **vowel substring** is a substring that **only** consists of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`) and has **all five** vowels present in it.

Given a string `word`, return the number of **vowel substrings** in `word`.
