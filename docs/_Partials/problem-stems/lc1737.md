You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to **any lowercase letter**.

Your goal is to satisfy **one** of the following three conditions:

- **Every** letter in `a` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `b` in the alphabet.
- **Every** letter in `b` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `a` in the alphabet.
- **Both** `a` and `b` consist of **only one** distinct letter.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to achieve your goal.
