We have `n` cities and `m` bi-directional `roads` where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> connects city <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> with city <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. Each city has a name consisting of exactly 3 upper-case English letters given in the string array `names`. Starting at any city `x`, you can reach any city `y` where `y != x` (i.e. the cities and the roads are forming an undirected connected graph).

You will be given a string array `targetPath`. You should find a path in the graph of the **same length** and with the **minimum edit distance** to `targetPath`.

You need to return the order of the nodes in the path with the minimum edit distance, The path should be of the same length of `targetPath` and should be valid (i.e. there should be a direct road between `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]`). If there are multiple answers return any one of them.

The **edit distance** is defined as follows:

```
define editDistance(targetPath, myPath) {
  dis := 0
  a := targetPath.length
  b := myPath.length
  if a != b {
    return 1000000000
  }
  for (i := 0; i < a; i += 1) {
    if targetPath[i] != myPath[i] {
      dis += 1
    }
  }
  return dis
}
```

**Follow-up:** If each node can be visited only once in the path, What should you change in your solution?
