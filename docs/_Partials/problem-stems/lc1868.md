**Run-length encoding** is a compression algorithm that allows for an integer array `nums` with many segments of **consecutive repeated** numbers to be represented by a (generally smaller) 2D array `encoded`. Each <code>encoded[i] = [val<sub>i</sub>, freq<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes the `i`th segment of repeated numbers in `nums` where <code>val<sub>i</sub></code> is the value that is repeated <code>freq<sub>i</sub></code> times.

For example, `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2]` is represented by the **run-length encoded** array `encoded = [[1,3],[2,5]]`. Another way to read this is "three `1`s followed by five `2`s".

The **product** of two run-length encoded arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` can be calculated using the following steps:

1. **Expand** both `encoded1` and `encoded2` into the full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
2. Create a new array `prodNums` of length `nums1.length` and set `prodNums[i] = nums1[i] * nums2[i]`.
3. **Compress** `prodNums` into a run-length encoded array and return it.

You are given two **run-length encoded** arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2` representing full arrays `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Both `nums1` and `nums2` have the same length. Each <code>encoded1[i] = [val<sub>i</sub>, freq<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes the `i`th segment of `nums1`, and each <code>encoded2[j] = [val<sub>j</sub>, freq<suby>j</suby>]</code> describes the `j`th segment of `nums2`.

Return the **product** of `encoded1` and `encoded2`.

**Note:** Compression should be done such that the run-length encoded array has the **minimum** possible length.
