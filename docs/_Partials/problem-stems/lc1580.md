You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `i`th room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:

- Boxes cannot be stacked.
- You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.
- Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from **either side** (left or right)
- If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.
