You have `n` processors each having `4` cores and `n * 4` tasks that need to be executed such that each core should perform only **one** task.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `processorTime` representing the time at which each processor becomes available for the first time and a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks` representing the time it takes to execute each task, return the **minimum** time when all of the tasks have been executed by the processors.

**Note:** Each core executes the task independently of the others.
