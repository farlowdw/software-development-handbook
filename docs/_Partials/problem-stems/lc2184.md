You are given integers `height` and `width` which specify the dimensions of a brick wall you are building. You are also given a **0-indexed** array of **unique** integers `bricks`, where the `i`th brick has a height of `1` and a width of `bricks[i]`. You have an **infinite** supply of each type of brick and bricks may **not** be rotated.

Each row in the wall must be exactly `width` units long. For the wall to be **sturdy**, adjacent rows in the wall should **not** join bricks at the same location, except at the ends of the wall.

Return the number of ways to build a **sturdy** wall. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
