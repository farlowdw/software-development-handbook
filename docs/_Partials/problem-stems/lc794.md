A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array `board`. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The `board` is a `3 x 3` array, and consists of characters `" "`, `"X"`, and `"O"`.  The `" "` character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (`" "`).
- The first player always places `"X"` characters, while the second player always places `"O"` characters.
- `"X"` and `"O"` characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
- The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.
