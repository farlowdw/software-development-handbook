You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to create a 2D array from `nums` satisfying the following conditions:

- The 2D array should contain **only** the elements of the array `nums`.
- Each row in the 2D array contains **distinct** integers.
- The number of rows in the 2D array should be **minimal**.

Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Note** that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.
