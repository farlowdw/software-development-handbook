Implement the `RandomizedCollection` class:

- `RandomizedCollection()` Initializes the `RandomizedCollection` object.
- `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the multiset if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
- `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the multiset if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise. Note that if `val` has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
- `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). The probability of each element being returned is **linearly related** to the number of same values the multiset contains.
