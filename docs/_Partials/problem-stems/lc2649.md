Given a **multi-dimensional** array of integers, return a generator object which yields integers in the same order as **inorder traversal**.

A **multi-dimensional** array is a recursive data structure that contains both integers and other **multi-dimensional** arrays.

**inorder traversal** iterates over each array from left to right, yielding any integers it encounters or applying **inorder traversal** to any arrays it encounters.
