Given a string `S`, find the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in `S`, and return that number modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A subsequence of a string `S` is obtained by deleting `0` or more characters from `S`.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.
