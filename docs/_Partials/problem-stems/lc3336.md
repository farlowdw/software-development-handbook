You are given an integer array `nums`.

Your task is to find the number of pairs of **non-empty** subsequences `(seq1, seq2)` of `nums` that satisfy the following conditions:

- The subsequences `seq1` and `seq2` are **disjoint**, meaning **no index** of `nums` is common between them.
- The GCD of the elements of `seq1` is equal to the GCD of the elements of `seq2`.

Return the total number of such pairs.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
