You are given two **sorted** arrays of distinct integers `nums1` and `nums2`.

A **valid path** is defined as follows:

- Choose array `nums1` or `nums2` to traverse (from index-0).
- Traverse the current array from left to right.
- If you are reading any value that is present in `nums1` and `nums2` you are allowed to change your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is considered in the valid path).

Score is defined as the sum of uniques values in a valid path.

Return the maximum score you can obtain of all possible **valid paths**.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
