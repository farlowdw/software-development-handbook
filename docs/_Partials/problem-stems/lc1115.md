Suppose you are given the following code:

```
class FooBar {
  public void foo() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("foo");
    }
  }

  public void bar() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("bar");
    }
  }
}
```

The same instance of `FooBar` will be passed to two different threads. Thread `A` will call `foo()` while thread `B` will call `bar()`. Modify the given program to output `"foobar"` `n` times.
