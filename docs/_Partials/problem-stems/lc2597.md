You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and a **positive** integer `k`.

A subset of `nums` is **beautiful** if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to `k`.

Return the number of **non-empty beautiful** subsets of the array `nums`.

A **subset** of `nums` is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
