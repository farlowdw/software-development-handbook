You have `n` bags numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `capacity` and `rocks`. The `i`th bag can hold a maximum of `capacity[i]` rocks and currently contains `rocks[i]` rocks. You are also given an integer `additionalRocks`, the number of additional rocks you can place in **any** of the bags.

Return the **maximum** number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.
