Alice had a **0-indexed** array `arr` consisting of `n` **positive** integers. She chose an arbitrary **positive integer** `k` and created two new **0-indexed** integer arrays `lower` and `higher` in the following manner:

1. `lower[i] = arr[i] - k`, for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n`
2. `higher[i] = arr[i] + k`, for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n`

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays `lower` and `higher`, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Given an array `nums` consisting of `2n` integers, where **exactly** `n` of the integers were present in `lower` and the remaining in `higher`, return the **original** array `arr`. In case the answer is not unique, return **any** valid array.

**Note:** The test cases are generated such that there exists **at least one** valid array `arr`.
