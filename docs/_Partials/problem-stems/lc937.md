You are given an array of `logs`. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the **identifier**.

There are two types of logs:

- **Letter-logs**: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
- **Digit-logs**: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:

1. The **letter-logs** come before all **digit-logs**.
2. The **letter-logs** are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
3. The **digit-logs** maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.
