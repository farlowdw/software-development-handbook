You are given `n` **BST (binary search tree) root nodes** for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array `trees` (**0-indexed**). Each BST in `trees` has **at most 3 nodes**, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:

- Select two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the **leaves** of `trees[i]` is equal to the **root value** of `trees[j]`.
- Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.
- Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.

Return the **root** of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing `n - 1` operations, or `null` if it is impossible to create a valid BST.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:

- Every node in the node's left subtree has a value **strictly less** than the node's value.
- Every node in the node's right subtree has a value **strictly greater** than the node's value.

A leaf is a node that has no children.
