Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest **common subsequence**. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
