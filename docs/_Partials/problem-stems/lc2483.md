You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a **0-indexed** string `customers` consisting only of characters `'N'` and `'Y'`:

- if the `i`th character is `'Y'`, it means that customers come at the `i`th hour
- whereas `'N'` indicates that no customers come at the `i`th hour.

If the shop closes at the `j`th hour (`0 <= j <= n`), the **penalty** is calculated as follows:

- For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by `1`.
- For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by `1`.

Return the **earliest** hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a **minimum** penalty.

**Note** that if a shop closes at the `j`th hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour `j`.
