You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each <code>logs[i] = [ID<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the user with <code>ID<sub>i</sub></code> performed an action at the minute <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>.

**Multiple users** can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform **multiple actions** in the same minute.

The **user active minutes (UAM)** for a given user is defined as the **number of unique minutes** in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a **1-indexed** array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the **number of users** whose **UAM** equals `j`.

Return the array `answer` as described above.
