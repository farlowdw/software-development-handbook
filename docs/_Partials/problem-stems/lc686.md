Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string `a` so that string `b` is a substring of it. If it is impossible for `b` to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated `0` times is `""`, repeated `1` time is `"abc"` and repeated `2` times is `"abcabc"`.
