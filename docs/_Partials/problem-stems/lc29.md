Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `truncate(8.345) = 8` and `truncate(-2.7335) = -2`.

**Note:**

- Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: <code>[-2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> - 1]</code>. For this problem, assume that your function returns <code>2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code> when the division result overflows.
