You are given two integers `n` and `k`.

Initially, you start with an array `a` of `n` integers where `a[i] = 1` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1`. After each second, you simultaneously update each element to be the sum of all its preceding elements plus the element itself. For example, after one second, `a[0]` remains the same, `a[1]` becomes `a[0] + a[1]`, `a[2]` becomes `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, and so on.

Return the **value** of `a[n - 1]` after `k` seconds.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
