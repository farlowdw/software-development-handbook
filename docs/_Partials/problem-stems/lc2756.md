Batching multiple small queries into a single large query can be a useful optimization. Write a class `QueryBatcher` that implements this functionality.

The constructor should accept two parameters:

- An asyncronous function `queryMultiple` which accepts an array of string keys `input`. It will resolve with an array of values that is the same length as the input array. Each index corresponds to the value associated with `input[i]`. You can assume the promise will never reject.
- A throttle time in milliseconds `t`.

The class has a single method.

- `async getValue(key)`. Accepts a single string key and resolves with a single string value. The keys passed to this function should eventually get passed to the `queryMultiple` function. `queryMultiple` should never be called consecutively within `t` milliseconds. The first time `getValue` is called, `queryMultiple` should immediately be called with that single key. If after `t` milliseconds, `getValue` had been called again, all the passed keys should be passed to `queryMultiple` and ultimately returned. You can assume every key passed to this method is unique.

The following diagram illustrates how the throttling algorithm works. Each rectangle represents 100ms. The throttle time is 400ms.
