You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:

- Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
- Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.

**Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.

Return the answer after performing the operations described above.
