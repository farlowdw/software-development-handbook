You have an **infinite** number of coins with values 1, 2, and 6, and **only** 2 coins with value 4.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of ways to make the sum of `n` with the coins you have.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that the order of the coins doesn't matter and `[2, 2, 3]` is the same as `[2, 3, 2]`.
