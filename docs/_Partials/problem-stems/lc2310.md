Given two integers `num` and `k`, consider a set of positive integers with the following properties:

- The units digit of each integer is `k`.
- The sum of the integers is `num`.

Return the **minimum** possible size of such a set, or `-1` if no such set exists.

**Note:**

- The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered `0`.
- The **units digit** of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.
