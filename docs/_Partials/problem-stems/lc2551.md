You have `k` bags. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `weights` where `weights[i]` is the weight of the `i`th marble. You are also given the integer `k`.

Divide the marbles into the `k` bags according to the following rules:

- No bag is empty.
- If the `i`th marble and `j`th marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the `i`th and `j`th indices should also be in that same bag.
- If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from `i` to `j` inclusively, then the cost of the bag is `weights[i] + weights[j]`.

The **score** after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the `k` bags.

Return the **difference** between the **maximum** and **minimum** scores among marble distributions.
