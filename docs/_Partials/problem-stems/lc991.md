On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations:

- **Double:** Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
- **Decrement:** Subtract 1 from the number on the display.

Initially, the calculator is displaying the number `X`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number `Y`.
