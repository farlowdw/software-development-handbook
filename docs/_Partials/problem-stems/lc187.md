The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

- For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.

When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.
