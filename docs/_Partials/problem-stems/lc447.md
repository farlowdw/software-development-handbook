You are given `n` `points` in the plane that are all **distinct**, where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. A **boomerang** is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k` **(the order of the tuple matters)**.

Return the number of boomerangs.
