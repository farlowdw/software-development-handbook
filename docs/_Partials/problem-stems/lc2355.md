You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `books` of length `n` where `books[i]` denotes the number of books on the `i`th shelf of a bookshelf.

You are going to take books from a **contiguous** section of the bookshelf spanning from `l` to `r` where `0 <= l <= r < n`. For each index `i` in the range `l <= i < r`, you must take **strictly fewer** books from shelf `i` than shelf `i + 1`.

Return the **maximum** number of books you can take from the bookshelf.
