Alice and Bob want to water `n` plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where the `i`th plant is located at `x = i`.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, **initially full**. They water the plants in the following way:

- Alice waters the plants in order from **left to right**, starting from the `0`th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from **right to left**, starting from the (`n - 1`)th plant. They begin watering the plants **simultaneously**.
- If one does not have enough water to **completely** water the current plant, he/she refills the watering can instantaneously.
- It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
- One **cannot** refill the watering can early.
- Each plant can be watered either by Alice or by Bob.
- In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with **more** water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `i`th plant needs, and two integers `capacityA` and `capacityB` representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the **number of times** they have to refill to water all the plants.
