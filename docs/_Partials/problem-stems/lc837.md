Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game `"21"`.

Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while she has less than `K` points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, W]`, where `W` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points. What is the probability that she has N or less points?
