You are given a **1-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers.

A set of numbers is **complete** if the product of every pair of its elements is a perfect square.

For a subset of the indices set `{1, 2, ..., n}` represented as <code>{i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, ..., i<sub>k</sub>}</code>, we define its element-sum as: <code>nums[i<sub>1</sub>] + nums[i<sub>2</sub>] + ... + nums[i<sub>k</sub>]</code>.

Return the **maximum element-sum** of a **complete** subset of the indices set `{1, 2, ..., n}`.

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer by itself.
