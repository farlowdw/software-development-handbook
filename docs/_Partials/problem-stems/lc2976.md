You are given two **0-indexed** strings `source` and `target`, both of length `n` and consisting of **lowercase** English letters. You are also given two **0-indexed** character arrays `original` and `changed`, and an integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` represents the cost of changing the character `original[i]` to the character `changed[i]`.

You start with the string `source`. In one operation, you can pick a character `x` from the string and change it to the character `y` at a cost of `z` **if** there exists **any** index `j` such that `cost[j] == z`, `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`.

Return the **minimum** cost to convert the string `source` to the string `target` using **any** number of operations. If it is impossible to convert `source` to `target`, return `-1`.

**Note** that there may exist indices `i`, `j` such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`.
