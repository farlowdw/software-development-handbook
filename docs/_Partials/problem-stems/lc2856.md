You are given a **0-indexed** sorted array of integers `nums`.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose **two** indices, `i` and `j`, where `i < j`, such that `nums[i] < nums[j]`.
- Then, remove the elements at indices `i` and `j` from `nums`. The remaining elements retain their original order, and the array is re-indexed.

Return an integer that denotes the **minimum** length of `nums` after performing the operation any number of times (**including zero**).
