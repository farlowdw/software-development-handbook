There is a **family tree** rooted at `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent for node `i`. Since node `0` is the **root**, `parents[0] == -1`.

There are <code>10<sup>5</sup></code> genetic values, each represented by an integer in the **inclusive** range <code>[1, 10<sup>5</sup>]</code>. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a **distinct** genetic value for node `i`.

Return an array `ans` of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the **smallest** genetic value that is **missing** from the subtree rooted at node `i`.

The **subtree** rooted at a node `x` contains node `x` and all of its **descendant** nodes.
