You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. Initially on minute `0`, the array is unchanged. Every minute, the **leftmost** element in `nums` is removed until no elements remain. Then, every minute, one element is appended to the **end** of `nums`, in the order they were removed in, until the original array is restored. This process repeats indefinitely.

- For example, the array `[0,1,2]` would change as follows: `[0,1,2] → [1,2] → [2] → [] → [0] → [0,1] → [0,1,2] → [1,2] → [2] → [] → [0] → [0,1] → [0,1,2] → ...`

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of size `n` where <code>queries[j] = [time<sub>j</sub>, index<sub>j</sub>]</code>. The answer to the `j`th query is:

- <code>nums[index<sub>j</sub>]</code> if <code>index<sub>j</sub> &lt; nums.length</code> at minute <code>time<sub>j</sub></code>
- `-1` if <code>index<sub>j</sub> >= nums.length</code> at minute <code>time<sub>j</sub></code>

Return an integer array `ans` of size `n` where `ans[j]` is the answer to the `j`th query.
