You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and a **positive** integer `k`.

The **power** of a subsequence is defined as the **minimum** absolute difference between **any** two elements in the subsequence.

Return the **sum** of **powers** of **all** subsequences of `nums` which have length **equal to** `k`.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
