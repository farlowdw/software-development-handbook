Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be [irreducible fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_fraction). If your final result is an integer, say `2`, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator `1`. So in this case, `2` should be converted to `2/1`.
