A string `s` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same **frequency**.

Given a string `s`, return the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make `s` **good**.

The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string `"aab"`, the frequency of `'a'` is `2`, while the frequency of `'b'` is `1`.
