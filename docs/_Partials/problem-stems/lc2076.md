You are given an integer `n` indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `restrictions`, where <code>restrictions[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that person <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and person <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> **cannot** become **friends**, either **directly** or **indirectly** through other people.

Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `requests`, where <code>requests[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]</code> is a friend request between person <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and person <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>.

A friend request is **successful** if <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code> can be **friends**. Each friend request is processed in the given order (i.e., requests[j] occurs before requests[j + 1]), and upon a successful request, <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code> **become direct friends** for all future friend requests.

Return a **boolean array** `result`, where each `result[j]` is `true` if the `j`th friend request is **successful** or `false` if it is not.

**Note:** If <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code> are already direct friends, the request is still **successful**.
