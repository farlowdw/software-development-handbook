Given an array `A`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:

- Every element in   is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
- `left` and `right` are non-empty.
- `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the **length** of `left` after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.
