Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.

You start with `0` points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
