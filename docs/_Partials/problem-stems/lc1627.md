We have `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. Two different cities with labels `x` and `y` are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if `x` and `y` share a common divisor **strictly greater** than some `threshold`. More formally, cities with labels `x` and `y` have a road between them if there exists an integer `z` such that all of the following are true:

- `x % z == 0,`
- `y % z == 0`, and
- `z > threshold`.

Given the two integers, `n` and `threshold`, and an array of `queries`, you must determine for each <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> if cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).

Return an array `answer`, where `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[i]` is true if for the `i`th query, there is a path between <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>, or `answer[i]` is `false` if there is no path.
