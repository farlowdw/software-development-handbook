You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each <code>logs[i] = [birth<sub>i</sub>, death<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates the birth and death years of the `i`th person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `i`th person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the **inclusive** range <code>[birth<sub>i</sub>, death<sub>i</sub> - 1]</code>. Note that the person is **not** counted in the year that they die.

Return the **earliest** year with the **maximum population**.
