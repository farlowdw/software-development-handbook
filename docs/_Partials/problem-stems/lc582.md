You have `n` processes forming a rooted tree structure. You are given two integer arrays `pid` and `ppid`, where `pid[i]` is the ID of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> process and `ppid[i]` is the ID of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> process's parent process.

Each process has only **one parent** process but may have multiple children processes. Only one process has `ppid[i] = 0`, which means this process has **no parent process** (the root of the tree).

When a process is **killed**, all of its children processes will also be killed.

Given an integer `kill` representing the ID of a process you want to kill, return a list of the IDs of the processes that will be killed. You may return the answer in **any order**.
