A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has street lamp(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array `lights`. Each <code>lights[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, range<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a street lamp at position <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> that lights up the area from <code>[position<sub>i</sub> - range<sub>i</sub>, position<sub>i</sub> + range<sub>i</sub>]</code> (**inclusive**).

The **brightness** of a position `p` is defined as the number of street lamp that light up the position `p`.

Given `lights`, return the **brightest** position on the street. If there are multiple brightest positions, return the **smallest** one.
