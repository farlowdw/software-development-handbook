Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string `equations[i]` has length `4` and takes one of two different forms: `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`.  Here, `a` and `b` are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.
