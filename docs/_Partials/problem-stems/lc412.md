Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (**1-indexed**) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by `3` and `5`.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by `3`.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by `5`.
- `answer[i] == i` if none of the above conditions are true.
