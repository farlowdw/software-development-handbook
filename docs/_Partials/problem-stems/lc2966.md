You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size `3` satisfying the following conditions:

- **Each** element of `nums` should be in **exactly** one array.
- The difference between **any** two elements in one array is less than or equal to `k`.

Return a **2D** array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return **any** of them.
