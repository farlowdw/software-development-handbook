Given a single positive integer `x`, we will write an expression of the form `x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ...` where each operator `op1`, `op2`, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`). For example, with `x = 3`, we might write `3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3` which is a value of `3`.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

- The division operator (`/`) returns rational numbers.
- There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
- We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
- It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (`-`). For example, "`x - x`" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "`-x + x`" is not because it uses negation.

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given `target`. Return the least number of operators used.
