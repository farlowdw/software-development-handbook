Given a **non-empty** string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times.

**Note:**

1. `k` will be a positive integer.
2. If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return **any of them**.
