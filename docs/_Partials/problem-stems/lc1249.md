Given a string `s` of `'('`, `')'` and lowercase English characters. 

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses (`'('` or `')'`, in any positions) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return **any** valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.
