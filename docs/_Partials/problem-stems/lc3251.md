You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums` of length `n`.

We call a pair of **non-negative** integer arrays `(arr1, arr2)` **monotonic** if:

- The lengths of both arrays are `n`.
- `arr1` is monotonically **non-decreasing**, in other words, `arr1[0] <= arr1[1] <= ... <= arr1[n - 1]`.
- `arr2` is monotonically **non-increasing**, in other words, `arr2[0] >= arr2[1] >= ... >= arr2[n - 1]`.
- `arr1[i] + arr2[i] == nums[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1`.

Return the count of **monotonic** pairs.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
