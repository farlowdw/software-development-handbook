There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `i`th node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Remove two **distinct** edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

1. Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for **each** of the three components respectively.
2. The **difference** between the **largest** XOR value and the **smallest** XOR value is the **score** of the pair.

- For example, say the three components have the node values: `[4,5,7]`, `[1,9]`, and `[3,3,3]`. The three XOR values are <code>4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = <u>6</u></code>, <code>1 ^ 9 = <u>8</u></code>, and <code>3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = <u>3</u></code>. The largest XOR value is `8` and the smallest XOR value is `3`. The score is then `8 - 3 = 5`.

Return the **minimum** score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
