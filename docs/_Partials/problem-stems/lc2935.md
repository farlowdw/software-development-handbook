You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of integers `x` and `y` is called a **strong** pair if it satisfies the condition:

- `|x - y| <= min(x, y)`

You need to select two integers from `nums` such that they form a strong pair and their bitwise `XOR` is the **maximum** among all strong pairs in the array.

Return the **maximum** `XOR` value out of all possible strong pairs in the array `nums`.

**Note** that you can pick the same integer twice to form a pair.
