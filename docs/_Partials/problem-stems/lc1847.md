There is a hotel with `n` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array `rooms` where <code>rooms[i] = [roomId<sub>i</sub>, size<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is a room with room number <code>roomId<sub>i</sub></code> and size equal to <code>size<sub>i</sub></code>. Each <code>roomId<sub>i</sub></code> is guaranteed to be **unique**.

You are also given `k` queries in a 2D array `queries` where <code>queries[j] = [preferred<sub>j</sub>, minSize<sub>j</sub>]</code>. The answer to the `j`th query is the room number `id` of a room such that:

- The room has a size of **at least** <code>minSize<sub>j</sub></code>, and
- <code>abs(id - preferred<sub>j</sub>)</code> is **minimized**, where `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

If there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such `id`. If there is **no such room**, the answer is `-1`.

Return an array `answer` of length `k` where `answer[j]` contains the answer to the `j`th query.
