You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, select **any** non-negative integer `x` and an index `i`, then **update** `nums[i]` to be equal to `nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)`.

Note that `AND` is the bitwise AND operation and `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the **maximum** possible bitwise XOR of all elements of `nums` after applying the operation **any number** of times.
