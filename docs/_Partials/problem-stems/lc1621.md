Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `i`th point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw **exactly** `k` **non-overlapping** line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have **integral coordinates**. The `k` line segments **do not** have to cover all `n` points, and they are **allowed** to share endpoints.

Return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
