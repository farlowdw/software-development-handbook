You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

Each `queries[i]` represents the following action on `nums`:

- Decrement the value at each index in the range <code>[l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> in `nums` by **at most** `1`.
- The amount by which the value is decremented can be chosen **independently** for each index.

A **Zero Array** is an array with all its elements equal to `0`.

Return the **maximum** number of elements that can be removed from `queries`, such that `nums` can still be converted to a **zero array** using the remaining queries. If it is not possible to convert `nums` to a **zero array**, return `-1`.
