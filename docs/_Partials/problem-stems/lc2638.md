You are given an integer array `nums`, which contains **distinct** elements and an integer `k`.

A subset is called a **k-Free** subset if it contains **no** two elements with an absolute difference equal to `k`. Notice that the empty set is a **k-Free** subset.

Return the number of **k-Free** subsets of `nums`.

A **subset** of an array is a selection of elements (possibly none) of the array.
