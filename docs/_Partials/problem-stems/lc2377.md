- `country` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table shows a country name and the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals it won in the Olympic games.

The `Olympic` table is sorted according to the following rules:

- The country with more gold medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the gold medals, the country with more silver medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the silver medals, the country with more bronze medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the bronze medals, the countries with the tie are sorted in ascending order lexicographically.

Write an SQL query to sort the Olympic table
