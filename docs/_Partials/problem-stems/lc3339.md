You are given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

An array `arr` is called **k-even** if there are **exactly** `k` indices such that, for each of these indices `i` (`0 <= i < n - 1`):

- `(arr[i] * arr[i + 1]) - arr[i] - arr[i + 1]` is even.

Return the number of possible **k-even** arrays of size n where all elements are in the range `[1, m]`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
