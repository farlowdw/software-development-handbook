You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the **same difficulty level**.

Return the **minimum** rounds required to complete all the tasks, or `-1` if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.
