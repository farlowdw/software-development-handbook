There is a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n`. Initially, all elements are **uncolored** (has a value of `0`).

You are given a 2D integer array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [index<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

For each query, you color the index <code>index<sub>i</sub></code> with the color <code>color<sub>i</sub></code> in the array `nums`.

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries` where `answer[i]` is the number of adjacent elements with the same color **after** the `i`th query.

More formally, `answer[i]` is the number of indices `j`, such that `0 <= j < n - 1` and `nums[j] == nums[j + 1]` and `nums[j] != 0` after the `i`th query.
