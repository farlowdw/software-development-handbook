You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`.

Consider a **non-empty** subarray from `nums` that has the **maximum** possible **bitwise AND**.

- In other words, let `k` be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of **any** subarray of `nums`. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to `k` should be considered.

Return the length of the **longest** such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
