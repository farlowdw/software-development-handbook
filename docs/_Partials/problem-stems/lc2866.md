You are given a **0-indexed** array `maxHeights` of `n` integers.

You are tasked with building `n` towers in the coordinate line. The `i`th tower is built at coordinate `i` and has a height of `heights[i]`.

A configuration of towers is **beautiful** if the following conditions hold:

1. `1 <= heights[i] <= maxHeights[i]`
2. `heights` is a **mountain** array.

Array `heights` is a **mountain** if there exists an index `i` such that:

- For all `0 < j <= i`, `heights[j - 1] <= heights[j]`
- For all `i <= k < n - 1`, `heights[k + 1] <= heights[k]`

Return the **maximum possible sum of heights** of a beautiful configuration of towers.
