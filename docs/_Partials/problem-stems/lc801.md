We have two integer sequences `A` and `B` of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements `A[i]` and `B[i]`.  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, `A` and `B` are both strictly increasing. (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if `A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1]`.)

Given `A` and `B`, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.
