Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return the minimal **total travel distance**.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.
