You are given a positive integer `days` representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array `meetings` of size `n` where, `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the starting and ending days of meeting `i` (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

**Note:** The meetings may overlap.
