A **valid cut** in a circle can be:

- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
- A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.

Some valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.

</div>

Given the integer `n`, return the **minimum** number of cuts needed to divide a circle into `n` equal slices.
