You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `i`th bus repeats forever.

- For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0`th bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever. You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from `source` to `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.
