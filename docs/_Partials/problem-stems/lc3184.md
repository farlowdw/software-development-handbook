Given an integer array `hours` representing times in **hours**, return an integer denoting the number of pairs `i`, `j` where `i < j` and `hours[i] + hours[j]` forms a **complete day**.

A **complete day** is defined as a time duration that is an **exact multiple** of 24 hours.

For example, 1 day is 24 hours, 2 days is 48 hours, 3 days is 72 hours, and so on.
