There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks **at the same time**. You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where <code>tasks[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, duration<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the `i`th task should run for a total of <code>duration<sub>i</sub></code> seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the **inclusive** time range <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.

Return the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks.
