Let `f(x)` be the number of zeroes at the end of `x!`. (Recall that `x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x`, and by convention, `0! = 1`.)

For example, `f(3) = 0` because `3! = 6` has no zeroes at the end, while `f(11) = 2` because `11! = 39916800` has `2` zeroes at the end. Given `K`, find how many non-negative integers `x` have the property that `f(x) = K`.
