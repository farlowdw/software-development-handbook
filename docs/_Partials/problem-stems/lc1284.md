Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbours of it if they exist (Flip is changing `1` to `0` and `0` to `1`). A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one edge.

Return the minimum number of steps required to convert `mat` to a zero matrix or **-1** if you cannot.

Binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to `0` or `1` only.

Zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to `0`.
