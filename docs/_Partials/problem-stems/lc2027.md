You are given a string `s` consisting of `n` characters which are either `'X'` or `'O'`.

A **move** is defined as selecting **three consecutive characters** of `s` and converting them to `'O'`. Note that if a move is applied to the character `'O'`, it will stay the **same**.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required so that all the characters of `s` are converted to `'O'`.
