You are given a string `compressed` representing a compressed version of a string. The format is a character followed by its frequency. For example, `"a3b1a1c2"` is a compressed version of the string `"aaabacc"`.

We seek a **better compression** with the following conditions:

1. Each character should appear **only once** in the compressed version.
2. The characters should be in **alphabetical order**.

Return the better compression of `compressed`.

**Note:** In the better version of compression, the order of letters may change, which is acceptable.
