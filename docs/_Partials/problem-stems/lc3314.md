You are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` prime integers.

You need to construct an array `ans` of length `n`, such that, for each index `i`, the bitwise `OR` of `ans[i]` and `ans[i] + 1` is equal to `nums[i]`, i.e. `ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i]`.

Additionally, you must **minimize** each value of `ans[i]` in the resulting array.

If it is not possible to find such a value for `ans[i]` that satisfies the **condition**, then set `ans[i] = -1`.
