You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where <code>positions[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> is the position <code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code> at which we should operate the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> operation.

Return an array of integers answer where `answer[i]` is the number of islands after turning the cell <code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code> into a land.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
