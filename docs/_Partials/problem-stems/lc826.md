We have jobs: `difficulty[i]` is the difficulty of the `i`th job, and `profit[i]` is the profit of the `i`th job. 

Now we have some workers. `worker[i]` is the ability of the `i`th worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[i]`. 

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if `3` people attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total profit will be `$3`.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is `$0`.

What is the most profit we can make?
