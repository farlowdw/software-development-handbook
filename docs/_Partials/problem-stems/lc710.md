Given a blacklist `B` containing unique integers from `[0, N)`, write a function to return a uniform random integer from `[0, N)` which is **NOT** in `B`.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s `Math.random()`.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= N <= 1000000000`
2. `0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)`
3. `[0, N)` does NOT include `N`. See [interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)).
