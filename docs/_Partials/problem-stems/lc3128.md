You are given a 2D boolean matrix `grid`.

Return an integer that is the number of **right triangles** that can be made with the 3 elements of `grid` such that **all** of them have a value of `1`.

**Note:**

- A collection of 3 elements of `grid` is a **right triangle** if one of its elements is in the **same row** with another element and in the **same column** with the third element. The 3 elements do not have to be next to each other.
