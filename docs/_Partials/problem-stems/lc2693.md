Enhance all functions to have the `callPolyfill` method. The method accepts an object `obj` as it's first parameter and any number of additional arguments. The `obj` becomes the `this` context for the function. The additional arguments are passed to the function (that the `callPolyfill` method belongs on).

For example if you had the function:

```js
function tax(price, taxRate) {
  const totalCost = price * (1 + taxRate);
  console.log(`The cost of ${this.item} is ${totalCost}`);
}
```

Calling this function like `tax(10, 0.1)` will log `"The cost of undefined is 11"`. This is because the `this` context was not defined.

However, calling the function like `tax.callPolyfill({item: "salad"}, 10, 0.1)` will log `"The cost of salad is 11"`. The `this` context was appropriately set, and the function logged an appropriate output.

Please solve this without using the built-in `Function.call` method.
