Given an array `arr` and a chunk size `size`, return a **chunked** array. A **chunked** array contains the original elements in `arr`, but consists of subarrays each of length `size`. The length of the last subarray may be less than `size` if `arr.length` is not evenly divisible by `size`.

You may assume the array is the output of `JSON.parse`. In other words, it is valid JSON.

Please solve it without using lodash's `_.chunk` function.
