You are given an integer array `matches` where <code>matches[i] = [winner<sub>i</sub>, loser<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the player <code>winner<sub>i</sub></code> defeated player <code>loser<sub>i</sub></code> in a match.

Return a list `answer` of size `2` where:

- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

**Note:**

- You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
- The testcases will be generated such that **no** two matches will have the **same** outcome.
