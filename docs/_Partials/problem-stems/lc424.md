Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

**Note:** Both the string's length and `k` will not exceed <code>10<sup>4</sup></code>.
