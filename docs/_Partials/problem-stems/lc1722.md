You are given two integer arrays, `source` and `target`, both of length `n`. You are also given an array `allowedSwaps` where each <code>allowedSwaps[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and index <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> **(0-indexed)** of array `source`. Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices **multiple** times and in **any** order.

The **Hamming distance** of two arrays of the same length, `source` and `target`, is the number of positions where the elements are different. Formally, it is the number of indices `i` for `0 <= i <= n-1` where `source[i] != target[i]` **(0-indexed)**.

Return the **minimum Hamming distance** of `source` and `target` after performing **any** amount of swap operations on array `source`.
