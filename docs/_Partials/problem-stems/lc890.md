You have a list of `words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which words in `words` matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in `words` that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.
