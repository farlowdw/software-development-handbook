You are given the `head` of a linked list of **even** length containing integers.

Each **odd-indexed** node contains an odd integer and each **even-indexed** node contains an even integer.

We call each even-indexed node and its next node a **pair**, e.g., the nodes with indices `0` and `1` are a pair, the nodes with indices `2` and `3` are a pair, and so on.

For every **pair**, we compare the values of the nodes in the pair:

- If the odd-indexed node is higher, the `"Odd"` team gets a point.
- If the even-indexed node is higher, the `"Even"` team gets a point.

Return the name of the team with the **higher** points, if the points are equal, return `"Tie"`.
