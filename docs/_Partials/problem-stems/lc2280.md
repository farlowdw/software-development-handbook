You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where <code>stockPrices[i] = [day<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates the price of the stock on day <code>day<sub>i</sub></code> is <code>price<sub>i</sub></code>. A **line chart** is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:

<p align='center'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/2280-f1.png').default} />
</p>

Return the **minimum number of lines** needed to represent the line chart.
