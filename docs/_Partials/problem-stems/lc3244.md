You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a **unidirectional** road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.

<code>queries[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the addition of a new **unidirectional** road from city <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to city <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. After each query, you need to find the **length** of the **shortest path** from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

There are no two queries such that `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.

Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the length of the shortest path from city `0` to city `n - 1` after processing the **first** `i + 1` queries.
