In a given array `nums` of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.

Each subarray will be of size `k`, and we want to maximize the sum of all `3*k` entries.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.
