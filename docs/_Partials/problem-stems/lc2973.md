You are given an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost` of length `n`, where `cost[i]` is the **cost** assigned to the `i`th node.

You need to place some coins on every node of the tree. The number of coins to be placed at node i can be calculated as:

- If size of the subtree of node `i` is less than `3`, place `1` coin.
- Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the **maximum** product of cost values assigned to `3` distinct nodes in the subtree of node `i`. If this product is **negative**, place `0` coins.

Return an array `coin` of size `n` such that `coin[i]` is the number of coins placed at node `i`.
