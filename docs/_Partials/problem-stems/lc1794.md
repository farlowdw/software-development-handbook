You are given two strings `firstString` and `secondString` that are **0-indexed** and consist only of lowercase English letters. Count the number of index quadruples `(i,j,a,b)` that satisfy the following conditions:

- `0 <= i <= j < firstString.length`
- `0 <= a <= b < secondString.length`
- The substring of `firstString` that starts at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> character and ends at the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> character (inclusive) is **equal** to the substring of `secondString` that starts at the <code>a<sup>th</sup></code> character and ends at the <code>b<sup>th</sup></code> character (inclusive).
- `j - a` is the **minimum** possible value among all quadruples that satisfy the previous conditions.

Return the **number** of such quadruples.
