You are given an `m x n` **0-indexed** 2D array of positive integers `heights` where `heights[i][j]` is the height of the person standing at position `(i, j)`.

A person standing at position <code>(row<sub>1</sub>, col<sub>1</sub>)</code> can see a person standing at position <code>(row<sub>2</sub>, col<sub>2</sub>)</code> if:

- The person at <code>(row<sub>2</sub>, col<sub>2</sub>)</code> is to the right **or** below the person at <code>(row<sub>1</sub>, col<sub>1</sub>)</code>. More formally, this means that either <code>row<sub>1</sub> == row<sub>2</sub></code> and <code>col<sub>1</sub> < col<sub>2</sub></code> **or** <code>row<sub>1</sub> < row<sub>2</sub></code> and <code>col<sub>1</sub> == col<sub>2</sub></code>.
- Everyone in between them is shorter than **both** of them.

Return an `m x n` 2D array of integers `answer` where `answer[i][j]` is the number of people that the person at position `(i, j)` can see.
