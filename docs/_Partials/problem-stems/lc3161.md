There exists an infinite number line, with its origin at `0` and extending towards the **positive** x-axis.

You are given a 2D array `queries`, which contains two types of queries:

1. For a query of type 1, `queries[i] = [1, x]`. Build an obstacle at distance `x` from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is no obstacle at distance `x` when the query is asked.
2. For a query of type 2, `queries[i] = [2, x, sz]`. Check if it is possible to place a block of size `sz` anywhere in the range `[0, x]` on the line, such that the block entirely lies in the range `[0, x]`. A block cannot be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do not actually place the block. Queries are separate.

Return a boolean array `results`, where `results[i]` is `true` if you can place the block specified in the `i`th query of type 2, and `false` otherwise.
