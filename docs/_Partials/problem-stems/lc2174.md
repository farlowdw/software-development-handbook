You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` **binary** matrix `grid`.

In one operation, you can choose any `i` and `j` that meet the following conditions:

- `0 <= i < m`
- `0 <= j < n`
- `grid[i][j] == 1`

and change the values of **all** cells in row `i` and column `j` to zero.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to remove all `1`'s from `grid`.
