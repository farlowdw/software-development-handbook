Given an array of integers `nums`, you can perform *any* number of operations on this array.

In each **operation**, you can:

- Choose a **prefix** of the array.
- Choose an integer `k` (which can be negative) and add `k` to each element in the chosen prefix.

A **prefix** of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make all elements in `arr` equal.
