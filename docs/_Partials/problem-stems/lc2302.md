The **score** of an array is defined as the **product** of its sum and its length.

- For example, the score of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75`.

Given a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the **number of non-empty subarrays** of `nums` whose score is **strictly less** than `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
