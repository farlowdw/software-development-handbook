You are given a string array `features` where `features[i]` is a single word representing the name of a feature of the latest product you are working on. You made a survey where users reported which features they like. You are given a string array `responses`, where `responses[i]` is a string containing space-separated words.

You want to sort the features according to their popularity. More formally, let `appearances(word)` be the number of is such that `responses[i]` contains `word` as a word. Then the <code>x<sup>th</sup></code> feature is more popular than the <code>y<sup>th</sup></code> feature if `appearances(features[x]) > appearances(features[y])`.

Return an array sortedFeatures consisting of the feature names sorted by their popularity. If the <code>x<sup>th</sup></code> and <code>y<sup>th</sup></code> features have the same popularity where `x < y`, then you should put the <code>x<sup>th</sup></code> feature before the <code>y<sup>th</sup></code> one.
