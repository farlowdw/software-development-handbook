You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `forts` of length `n` representing the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:

- `-1` represents there is **no fort** at the `i`th position.
- `0` indicates there is an **enemy** fort at the `i`th position.
- `1` indicates the fort at the `i`th the position is under your command.

Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i` to an empty position `j` such that:

- `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`
- The army travels over enemy forts **only**. Formally, for all `k` where `min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)`, `forts[k] == 0`.

While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are **captured**.

Return the **maximum** number of enemy forts that can be captured. In case it is **impossible** to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return `0`.
