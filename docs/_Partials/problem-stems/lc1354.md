Given an array of integers `target`. From a starting array, `A` consisting of all `1`'s, you may perform the following procedure :

- let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
- choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < target.size` and set the value of `A` at index `i` to `x`.
- You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return `True` if it is possible to construct the `target` array from `A` otherwise return `False`.
