You are given two arrays of equal length, `nums1` and `nums2`.

Each element in `nums1` has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable `x`.

As a result, `nums1` becomes **equal** to `nums2`. Two arrays are considered **equal** when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

Return the integer `x`.
