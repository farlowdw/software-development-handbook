You are given a 2D integer array `edges` representing a tree with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, rooted at node `0`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> means there is an edge between the nodes <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>u<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `colors` of size `n`, where `colors[i]` is the color assigned to node `i`.

We want to find a node `v` such that every node in the subtree of `v` has the **same** color.

Return the size of such subtree with the **maximum** number of nodes possible.
