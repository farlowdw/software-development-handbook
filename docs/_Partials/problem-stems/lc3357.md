You are given an array of integers `nums`. Some values in `nums` are **missing** and are denoted by `-1`.

You can choose a pair of **positive** integers `(x, y)` **exactly once** and replace each **missing** element with either `x` or `y`.

You need to **minimize** the **maximum absolute difference** between adjacent elements of `nums` after replacements.

Return the **minimum** possible difference.
