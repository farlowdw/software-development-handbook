You have `n` robots. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `i`th robot costs `chargeTimes[i]` units to charge and costs runningCosts[i] units to run. You are also given an integer `budget`.

The **total cost** of running `k` chosen robots is equal to `max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts)`, where `max(chargeTimes)` is the largest charge cost among the `k` robots and `sum(runningCosts)` is the sum of running costs among the `k` robots.

Return the **maximum** number of **consecutive** robots you can run such that the total cost **does not** exceed `budget`.
