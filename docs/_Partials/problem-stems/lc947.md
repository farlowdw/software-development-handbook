On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either **the same row or the same column** as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where <code>stones[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the location of the `i`th stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
