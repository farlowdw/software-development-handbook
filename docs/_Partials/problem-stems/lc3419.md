You are given two integers, `n` and `threshold`, as well as a **directed** weighted graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>, W<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge going from node <code>A<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>B<sub>i</sub></code> with <code>weight W<sub>i</sub></code>.

You have to remove some edges from this graph (possibly **none**), so that it satisfies the following conditions:

- Node `0` must be reachable from all other nodes.
- The **maximum** edge weight in the resulting graph is **minimized**.
- Each node has **at most** `threshold` outgoing edges.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** edge weight after removing the necessary edges. If it is impossible for all conditions to be satisfied, return `-1`.
