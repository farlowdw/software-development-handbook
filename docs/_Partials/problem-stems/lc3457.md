You are given an integer array `pizzas` of size `n`, where `pizzas[i]` represents the weight of the `i`th pizza. Every day, you eat exactly 4 pizzas. Due to your incredible metabolism, when you eat pizzas of weights `W`, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, where `W <= X <= Y <= Z`, you gain the weight of only `1` pizza!

- On odd-numbered days (1-indexed), you gain a weight of `Z`.
- On even-numbered days, you gain a weight of `Y`.

Find the maximum total weight you can gain by eating all pizzas optimally.

Note: It is guaranteed that `n` is a multiple of `4`, and each pizza can be eaten only once.
