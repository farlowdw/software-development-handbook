Given an integer `n`. No-Zero integer is a positive integer which **doesn't contain any 0** in its decimal representation.

Return a list of two integers `[A, B]` where:

- `A` and `B` are No-Zero integers.
- `A + B = n`

It's guarateed that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.
