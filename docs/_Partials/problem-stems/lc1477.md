Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.
