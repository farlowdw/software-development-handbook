There is a **directed graph** of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the **color** of the `i`th node in this graph (**0-indexed**). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where <code>edges[j] = [a<sub>j</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node <code>a<sub>j</sub></code> to node <code>b<sub>j</sub></code>.

A valid **path** in the graph is a sequence of nodes <code>x<sub>1</sub> -> x<sub>2</sub> -> x<sub>3</sub> -> ... -> x<sub>k</sub></code> such that there is a directed edge from <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>x<sub>i+1</sub></code> for every `1 <= i < k`. The **color value** of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the **most frequently** occurring color along that path.

Return the **largest color value** of any valid path in the given graph, or `-1` if the graph contains a cycle.
