You are given a **0-indexed** array of **positive** integers `nums` and a **positive** integer `limit`.

In one operation, you can choose any two indices `i` and `j` and swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` **if** `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest array** that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.

An array `a` is lexicographically smaller than an array `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, array `a` has an element that is less than the corresponding element in `b`. For example, the array `[2,10,3]` is lexicographically smaller than the array `[10,2,3]` because they differ at index `0` and `2 < 10`.
