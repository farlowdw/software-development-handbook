You are given an integer array `nums`. The value of this array is defined as the sum of `|nums[i]-nums[i+1]|` for all `0 <= i < nums.length-1`.

You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You can perform this operation **only once**.

Find maximum possible value of the final array.
