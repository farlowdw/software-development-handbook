You are given an array of integers `nums` of size `n` and a **positive** integer `threshold`.

There is a graph consisting of `n` nodes with the `i`th node having a value of `nums[i]`. Two nodes `i` and `j` in the graph are connected via an **undirected** edge if `lcm(nums[i], nums[j]) <= threshold`.

Return the number of **connected components** in this graph.

A **connected component** is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

The term `lcm(a, b)` denotes the **least common multiple** of `a` and `b`.
