You are given three **positive** integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

In a city, there exist houses numbered `1` to `n` connected by `n` streets. There is a street connecting the house numbered `i` with the house numbered `i + 1` for all `1 <= i <= n - 1`. An additional street connects the house numbered `x` with the house numbered `y`.

For each `k`, such that `1 <= k <= n`, you need to find the number of **pairs of houses** <code>(house<sub>1</sub>, house<sub>2</sub>)</code> such that the **minimum** number of streets that need to be traveled to reach <code>house<sub>2</sub></code> from <code>house<sub>1</sub></code> is `k`.

Return a **1-indexed** array `result` of length `n` where `result[k]` represents the **total** number of pairs of houses such that the **minimum** streets required to reach one house from the other is `k`.

**Note** that `x` and `y` can be **equal**.
