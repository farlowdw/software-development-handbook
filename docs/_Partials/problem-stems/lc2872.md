There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` of length `n`, where `values[i]` is the **value** associated with the `i`th node, and an integer `k`.

A **valid split** of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by `k`, where the **value of a connected component** is the sum of the values of its nodes.

Return the **maximum number of components** in any valid split.
