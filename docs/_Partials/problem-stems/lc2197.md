You are given an array of integers `nums`. Perform the following steps:

1. Find **any** two **adjacent** numbers in `nums` that are **non-coprime**.
2. If no such numbers are found, **stop** the process.
3. Otherwise, delete the two numbers and **replace** them with their **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**.
4. **Repeat** this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.

Return the **final** modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to <code>10<sup>8</sup></code>.

Two values `x` and `y` are **non-coprime** if `GCD(x, y) > 1` where `GCD(x, y)` is the **Greatest Common Divisor** of `x` and `y`.
