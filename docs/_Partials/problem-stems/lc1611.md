Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:

- Change the rightmost (`0`th) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
- Change the `i`th bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)`th bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)`th through `0`th bits are set to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into `0`.
