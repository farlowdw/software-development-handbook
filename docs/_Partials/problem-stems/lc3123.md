You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph consists of `m` edges represented by a 2D array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

Consider all the shortest paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` in the graph. You need to find a **boolean** array `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if the edge `edges[i]` is part of **at least** one shortest path. Otherwise, `answer[i]` is `false`.

Return the array `answer`.

**Note** that the graph may not be connected.
