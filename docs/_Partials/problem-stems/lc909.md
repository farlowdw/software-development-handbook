On an `N x N` `board`, the numbers from `1` to `N*N` are written boustrophedonically **starting from the bottom left of the board**, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:

</p>

You start on square `1` of the board (which is always in the last row and first column). Each move, starting from square `x`, consists of the following:

- You choose a destination square `S` with number `x+1`, `x+2`, `x+3`, `x+4`, `x+5`, or `x+6`, provided this number is `<= N*N`.
 + (This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always **at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board**.)
- If `S` has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `S`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a "snake or ladder" if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** continue moving. (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do **not** continue moving to `4`.)

Return the least number of moves required to reach square `N*N`. If it is not possible, return `-1`.
