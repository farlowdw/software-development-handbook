Design and implement a data structure for a compressed string iterator. The given compressed string will be in the form of each letter followed by a positive integer representing the number of this letter existing in the original uncompressed string.

Implement the `StringIterator` class:

- `next()` Returns **the next character** if the original string still has uncompressed characters, otherwise returns a **white space**.
- `hasNext()` Returns true if there is any letter needs to be uncompressed in the original string, otherwise returns `false`.
