Given a string `word` to which you can insert letters `"a"`, `"b"` or `"c"` anywhere and any number of times, return the minimum number of letters that must be inserted so that `word` becomes **valid**.

A string is called **valid** if it can be formed by concatenating the string `"abc"` several times.
