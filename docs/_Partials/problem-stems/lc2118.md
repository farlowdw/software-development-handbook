**Table:** `Terms`

| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| power       | int  |
| factor      | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `power` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about one term of the equation.
- `power` is an integer in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `factor` is an integer in the range `[-100, 100]` and cannot be zero.

You have a very powerful program that can solve any equation of one variable in the world. The equation passed to the program must be formatted as follows:

- The left-hand side (LHS) should contain all the terms.
- The right-hand side (RHS) should be zero.
- Each term of the LHS should follow the format `"<sign><fact>X^<pow>"` where:
  + `<sign>` is either `"+"` or `"-"`.
  + `<fact>` is the **absolute value** of the `factor`.
  + `<pow>` is the value of the `power`.
- If the power is `1`, do not add `"^<pow>"`.
  + For example, if `power = 1` and `factor = 3`, the term will be `"+3X"`.
- If the power is 0, add neither "X" nor `"^<pow>"`.
  + For example, if `power = 0` and `factor = -3`, the term will be `"-3"`.
- The powers in the LHS should be sorted in **descending order**.

Write an SQL query to build the equation.

The query result format is in the following example.
