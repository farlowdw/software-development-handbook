You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

- If the element is **even**, **divide** it by `2`.
  + For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be <code>[1,2,3,<u>2</u>]</code>.
- If the element is **odd**, **multiply** it by `2`.
  + For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be <code>[<u>2</u>,2,3,4]</code>.

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.

Return the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some number of operations.
