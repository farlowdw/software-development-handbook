You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, `strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"]` can be arranged as:

```
abc
bce
cae
```

You want to **delete** the columns that are **not sorted lexicographically**. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`) and 2 (`'c'`, `'e'`, `'e'`) are sorted while column 1 (`'b'`, `'c'`, `'a'`) is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.
