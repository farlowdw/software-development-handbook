You are given a root which is the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes. The nodes of the binary tree are numbered from `1` to `n`. Suppose the tree has `k` leaves in the following order: <code>b<sub>1</sub> &lt; b<sub>2</sub> &lt; ... &lt; b<sub>k</sub></code>.

The leaves of this tree have a special property! That is, for every leaf <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>, the following conditions hold:

- The right child of <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> is <code>b<sub>i + 1</sub></code> if <code>i &lt; k</code>, and <code>b<sub>1</sub></code> otherwise.
- The left child of <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> is <code>b<sub>i - 1</sub></code> if <code>i > 1</code>, and <code>b<sub>k</sub></code> otherwise.

Return the height of the given tree.

**Note:** The height of a binary tree is the length of the **longest path** from the root to any other vertex.
