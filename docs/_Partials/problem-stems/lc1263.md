Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by a `grid` of size `m x n`, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.

Your task is move the box `'B'` to the target position `'T'` under the following rules:

- Player is represented by character `'S'` and can move up, down, left, right in the `grid` if it is a floor (empy cell).
- Floor is represented by character `'.'` that means free cell to walk.
- Wall is represented by character `'#'` that means obstacle  (impossible to walk there). 
- There is only one box `'B'` and one target cell `'T'` in the `grid`.
- The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a **push**.
- The player cannot walk through the box.

Return the minimum number of **pushes** to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.
