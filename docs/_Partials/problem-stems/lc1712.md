A split of an integer array is **good** if:

- The array is split into three **non-empty** contiguous subarrays - named `left`, `mid`, `right` respectively from left to right.
- The sum of the elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `mid`, and the sum of the elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `right`.

Given `nums`, an array of **non-negative** integers, return the number of **good** ways to split `nums`. As the number may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
