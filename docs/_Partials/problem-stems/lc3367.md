There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Your task is to remove zero or more edges such that:

- Each node has an edge with **at most** `k` other nodes, where `k` is given.
- The sum of the weights of the remaining edges is **maximized**.

Return the **maximum** possible sum of weights for the remaining edges after making the necessary removals.
