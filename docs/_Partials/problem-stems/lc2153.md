**Table:** `Buses`

```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| bus_id       | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
| capacity     | int  |
+--------------+------+
```

- `bus_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the Leetcode station and its capacity (i.e., the number of empty seats it has).
- There will be no two buses that arrive at the same time and capacity will be a positive integer.

**Table:** `Passengers`

```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
```

- `passenger_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the Leetcode station.

Buses and passengers arrive at the Leetcode station. If a bus arrives at the station at a time <code>t<sub>bus</sub></code> and a passenger arrived at a time <code>t<sub>passenger</sub></code> where <code>t<sub>passenger</sub> <= t<sub>bus</sub></code> and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus. In addition, each bus has a capacity. If at the moment the bus arrives at the station there are more passengers waiting than its capacity `capacity`, only `capacity` passengers will use the bus.

Write an SQL query to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by `bus_id` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
