Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the `null` nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
