You are given an `n * m` **0-indexed** grid of string `land`. Right now, you are standing at the cell that contains `"S"`, and you want to get to the cell containing `"D"`. There are three other types of cells in this land:

- `"."`: These cells are empty.
- `"X"`: These cells are stone.
- `"*"`: These cells are flooded.

At each second, you can move to a cell that shares a side with your current cell (if it exists). Also, at each second, every **empty cell** that shares a side with a flooded cell becomes flooded as well.

There are two problems ahead of your journey:

- You can't step on stone cells.
- You can't step on flooded cells since you will drown (also, you can't step on a cell that will be flooded at the same time as you step on it).

Return the **minimum** time it takes you to reach the destination in seconds, or `-1` if it is impossible.

**Note** that the destination will never be flooded.
