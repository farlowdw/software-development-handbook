You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where <code>properties[i] = [attack<sub>i</sub>, defense<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the properties of the `i`th character in the game.

A character is said to be **weak** if any other character has **both** attack and defense levels **strictly greater** than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is said to be **weak** if there exists another character `j` where <code>attack<sub>j</sub> > attack<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>defense<sub>j</sub> > defense<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return the number of **weak** characters.
