Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters `palindrome`, replace **exactly one** character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is **not** a palindrome and that it is the **lexicographically smallest** one possible.

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an **empty string**.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `"abcc"` is lexicographically smaller than `"abcd"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `'c'` is smaller than `'d'`.
