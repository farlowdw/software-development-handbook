Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of **subarrays** of `nums` where the least common multiple of the subarray's elements is `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

The **least common multiple of an array** is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the array elements.
