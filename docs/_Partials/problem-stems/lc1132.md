**Table:** `Actions`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    |
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```

- There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
- The `action` column is an `ENUM` type of `('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share')`.
- The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction. 

**Table:** `Removals`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| post_id       | int     |
| remove_date   | date    | 
+---------------+---------+
```

- `post_id` is the primary key of this table.
- Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed as a result of being reported or as a result of an admin review.

Write an SQL query to find the average for daily percentage of posts that got removed after being reported as spam, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+

Result table:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
```

- The percentage for `2019-07-04` is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts was removed.
- The percentage for `2019-07-02` is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
- The other days had no spam reports so the average is `(50 + 100) / 2 = 75%`.
- Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
