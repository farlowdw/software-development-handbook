You are given a **binary** string `s` that contains at least one `'1'`.

You have to **rearrange** the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the **maximum odd binary number** that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

**Note** that the resulting string **can** have leading zeros.
