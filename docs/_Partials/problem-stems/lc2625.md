Given a **multi-dimensional** array `arr` and a depth `n`, return a **flattened** version of that array.

A **multi-dimensional** array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other **multi-dimensional** arrays.

A **flattened** array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is greater than `n`. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be `0`.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.
