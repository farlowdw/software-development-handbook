Given an integer array `queries` and a **positive** integer `intLength`, return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is either the `queries[i]`th smallest **positive palindrome** of length `intLength` or `-1` if no such palindrome exists.

A **palindrome** is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.
