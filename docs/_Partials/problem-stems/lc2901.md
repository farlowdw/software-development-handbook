You are given an integer `n`, a **0-indexed** string array `words`, and a **0-indexed** array `groups`, both arrays having length `n`.

The **hamming distance** between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are **different**.

You need to select the **longest subsequence** from an array of indices `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`, such that for the subsequence denoted as <code>[i<sub>0</sub>, i<sub>1</sub>, ..., i<sub>k - 1</sub>]</code> having length `k`, the following holds:

- For **adjacent** indices in the subsequence, their corresponding groups are **unequal**, i.e., <code>groups[i<sub>j</sub>] != groups[i<sub>j + 1</sub>]</code>, for each `j` where `0 < j + 1 < k`.
- <code>words[i<sub>j</sub>]</code> and <code>words[i<sub>j + 1</sub>]</code> are <strong>equal</strong> in length, and the <strong>hamming distance</strong> between them is <code>1</code>, where <code>0 &lt; j + 1 &lt; k</code>, for all indices in the subsequence.

Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices **(in order)** in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.

**Note:** strings in `words` may be **unequal** in length.
