You are given a string `s` consisting **only** of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one **palindromic subsequence** from `s`.

Return the **minimum** number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a **subsequence** of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does **not** necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called **palindrome** if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.
