The **numeric value** of a **lowercase character** is defined as its position (**1-indexed**) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of `a` is `1`, the numeric value of `b` is `2`, the numeric value of `c` is `3`, and so on.

The **numeric value** of a **string** consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string `"abe"` is equal to `1 + 2 + 5 = 8`.

You are given two integers `n` and `k`. Return the **lexicographically smallest string** with **length** equal to `n` and **numeric value** equal to `k`.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.
