You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` represents the value of the `i`th sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have a **distance** `j - i` between them.

The score of a pair (`i < j`) of sightseeing spots is values`[i] + values[j] + i - j`: the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance between them.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.
