You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job.

There are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.

Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment.
