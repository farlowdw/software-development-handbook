You are given an array of equal-length strings `words`. Assume that the length of each string is `n`.

Each string `words[i]` can be converted into a **difference integer array** `difference[i]` of length `n - 1` where `difference[i][j] = words[i][j+1] - words[i][j]` where `0 <= j <= n - 2`. Note that the difference between two letters is the difference between their **positions** in the alphabet i.e. the position of `'a'` is `0`, `'b'` is `1`, and `'z'` is `25`.

- For example, for the string `"acb"`, the difference integer array is `[2 - 0, 1 - 2] = [2, -1]`.

All the strings in words have the same difference integer array, **except one**. You should find that string.

Return the string in `words` that has different **difference integer array**.
