Given an array of integers `A`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `A`.

For any sequence `S`, let the width of `S` be the difference between the maximum and minimum element of `S`.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of `A`. 

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
