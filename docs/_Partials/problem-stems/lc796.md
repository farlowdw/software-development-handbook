We are given two strings, `A` and `B`.

A shift on `A` consists of taking string `A` and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if `A = 'abcde'`, then it will be `'bcdea'` after one shift on `A`. Return `True` if and only if `A` can become `B` after some number of shifts on `A`.
