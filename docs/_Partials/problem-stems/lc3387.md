You are given a string `initialCurrency`, and you start with `1.0` of `initialCurrency`.

You are also given four arrays with currency pairs (strings) and rates (real numbers):

- <code>pairs1[i] = [startCurrency<sub>i</sub>, targetCurrency<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that you can convert from <code>startCurrency<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>targetCurrency<sub>i</sub></code> at a rate of <code>rates1[i]</code> on day <code>1</code>.
- <code>pairs2[i] = [startCurrency<sub>i</sub>, targetCurrency<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that you can convert from <code>startCurrency<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>targetCurrency<sub>i</sub></code> at a rate of <code>rates2[i]</code> on day <code>2</code>.
- Also, each `targetCurrency` can be converted back to its corresponding `startCurrency` at a rate of `1 / rate`.

You can perform **any** number of conversions, **including zero**, using `rates1` on day 1, **followed** by any number of additional conversions, **including zero**, using `rates2` on day 2.

Return the **maximum** amount of `initialCurrency` you can have after performing any number of conversions on both days **in order**.

**Note:** Conversion rates are valid, and there will be no contradictions in the rates for either day. The rates for the days are independent of each other.
