You are given an array `tasks` where <code>tasks[i] = [actual<sub>i</sub>, minimum<sub>i</sub>]</code>:

- <code>actual<sub>i</sub></code> is the actual amount of energy you **spend to finish** the `i`th task.
- <code>minimum<sub>i</sub></code> is the minimum amount of energy you **require to begin** the `i`th task.

For example, if the task is `[10, 12]` and your current energy is `11`, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is `13`, you can complete this task, and your energy will be `3` after finishing it.

You can finish the tasks in **any order** you like.

Return the **minimum** initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.
