A string `originalText` is encoded using a **slanted transposition cipher** to a string `encodedText` with the help of a matrix having a **fixed number of rows** `rows`.

`originalText` is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.

</p>

The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of `originalText`. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with `' '`. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will **not be empty** after filling in `originalText`.

`encodedText` is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.

</p>

The characters in the blue cells are appended first to `encodedText`, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.

For example, if `originalText = "cipher"` and `rows = 3`, then we encode it in the following manner:

<p align='center'>
  <img width='350px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/2075-f3.png').default} />
</p>

The blue arrows depict how originalText is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which `encodedText` is formed. In the above example, `encodedText = "ch ie pr"`.

Given the encoded string `encodedText` and number of rows `rows`, return the original string `originalText`.

**Note:** `originalText` **does not** have any trailing spaces `' '`. The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible `originalText`.
