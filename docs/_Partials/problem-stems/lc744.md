Given a list of sorted characters `letters` containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter `target`, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is `target = 'z'` and `letters = ['a', 'b']`, the answer is `'a'`.
