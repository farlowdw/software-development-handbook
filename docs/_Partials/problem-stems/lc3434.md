You are given an array `nums` of length `n`. You are also given an integer `k`.

You perform the following operation on `nums` once:

- Select a subarray `nums[i..j]` where `0 <= i <= j <= n - 1`.
- Select an integer `x` and add `x` to all the elements in `nums[i..j]`.

Find the **maximum** frequency of the value `k` after the operation.
