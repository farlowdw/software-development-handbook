You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` of length `n` on which you can apply two types of operations:

- Choose an index `i` and invert all characters from index `0` to index `i` (both inclusive), with a cost of `i + 1`
- Choose an index `i` and invert all characters from index `i` to index `n - 1` (both inclusive), with a cost of `n - i`

Return the **minimum cost** to make all characters of the string **equal**.

**Invert** a character means if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.
