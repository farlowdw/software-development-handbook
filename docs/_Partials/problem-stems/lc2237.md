You are given an integer `n`. A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line ranging from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `lights` representing the street lamp(s) on the street. Each <code>lights[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, range<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a street lamp at position <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> that lights up the area from <code>[max(0, position<sub>i</sub> - range<sub>i</sub>), min(n - 1, position<sub>i</sub> + range<sub>i</sub>)]</code> (**inclusive**).

The **brightness** of a position `p` is defined as the number of street lamps that light up the position `p`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `requirement` of size `n` where `requirement[i]` is the minimum **brightness** of the `i`th position on the street.

Return the number of positions `i` on the street between `0` and `n - 1` that have a **brightness** of **at least** `requirement[i]`.
