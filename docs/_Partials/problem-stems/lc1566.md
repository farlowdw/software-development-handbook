Given an array of positive integers `arr`, find a pattern of length m that is repeated `k` or more times.

A **pattern** is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times **consecutively** without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return `true` if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return `false`.
