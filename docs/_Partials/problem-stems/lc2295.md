You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` that consists of `n` **distinct** positive integers. Apply `m` operations to this array, where in the `i`th operation you replace the number `operations[i][0]` with `operations[i][1]`.

It is guaranteed that in the `i`th operation:

- `operations[i][0]` **exists** in `nums`.
- `operations[i][1]` does **not** exist in `nums`.

Return the array obtained after applying all the operations.
