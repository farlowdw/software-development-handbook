You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.
