Given two positive integers `m` and `n` which are the height and width of a **0-indexed** 2D-array `board`, a pair of positive integers `(r, c)` which is the starting position of the knight on the board.

Your task is to find an order of movements for the knight, in a manner that every cell of the `board` gets visited **exactly** once (the starting cell is considered visited and you **shouldn't** visit it again).

Return the array `board` in which the cells' values show the order of visiting the cell starting from 0 (the initial place of the knight).

Note that a **knight** can **move** from cell `(r1, c1)` to cell `(r2, c2)` if `0 <= r2 <= m - 1` and `0 <= c2 <= n - 1` and `min(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 1` and `max(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 2`.
