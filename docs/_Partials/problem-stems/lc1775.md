You are given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`, possibly of different lengths. The values in the arrays are between `1` and `6`, inclusive.

In one operation, you can change any integer's value in **any** of the arrays to **any** value between `1` and `6`, inclusive.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in `nums1` equal to the sum of values in `nums2`. Return `-1` if it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.
