In a given 2D binary array `A`, there are two islands.  (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s not connected to any other `1`s.)

Now, we may change `0`s to `1`s so as to connect the two islands together to form `1` island.

Return the smallest number of `0`s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least `1`.)
