Given a list of `phrases`, generate a list of Before and After puzzles.

A phrase is a string that consists of lowercase English letters and spaces only. No space appears in the start or the end of a phrase. There are no consecutive spaces in a phrase.

Before and After puzzles are phrases that are formed by merging two phrases where the **last word of the first phrase** is the same as the **first word of the second phrase**.

Return the Before and After puzzles that can be formed by every two phrases `phrases[i]` and `phrases[j]` where `i != j`. Note that the order of matching two phrases matters, we want to consider both orders.

You should return a list of **distinct** strings **sorted lexicographically**.
