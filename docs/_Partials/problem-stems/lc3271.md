You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, where `n` is a **multiple** of `k`. Your task is to hash the string `s` into a new string called `result`, which has a length of `n / k`.

First, divide `s` into `n / k` **substrings**, each with a length of `k`. Then, initialize `result` as an **empty** string.

For each **substring** in order from the beginning:

- The **hash value** of a character is the index of that character in the **English alphabet** (e.g., `'a' → 0`, `'b' → 1`, ..., `'z' → 25`).
- Calculate the *sum* of all the **hash values** of the characters in the substring.
- Find the remainder of this sum when divided by `26`, which is called `hashedChar`.
- Identify the character in the English lowercase alphabet that corresponds to `hashedChar`.
- Append that character to the end of `result`.

Return `result`.
