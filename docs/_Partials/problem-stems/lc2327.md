On day `1`, one person discovers a secret.

You are given an integer `delay`, which means that each person will **share** the secret with a new person **every day**, starting from `delay` days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer `forget`, which means that each person will **forget** the `secret` forget days after discovering it. A person **cannot** share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day `n`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
