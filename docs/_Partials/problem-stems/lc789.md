You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point `[0, 0]`, and you are given a destination point <code>target = [x<sub>target</sub>, y<sub>target</sub>]</code>, which you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as an array `ghosts`, where <code>ghosts[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the starting position of the `i`th ghost. All inputs are **integral coordinates**.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either **move 1 unit** in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west or **stay still**. All actions happen **simultaneously**.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target **before** any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the **same time** as a ghost, it **does not** count as an escape.

Return `true` if it is possible to escape, otherwise return `false`.
