You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. In the game, Alice can choose **either** all single-digit numbers or all double-digit numbers from `nums`, and the rest of the numbers are given to Bob. Alice wins if the sum of her numbers is **strictly greater** than the sum of Bob's numbers.

Return `true` if Alice can win this game, otherwise, return `false`.
