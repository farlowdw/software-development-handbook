You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid`. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner `(0, 0)`, and in each step, you can only **move right or down** in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and ending in the bottom-right corner `(rows - 1, cols - 1)`, find the path with the **maximum non-negative product**. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the maximum non-negative product **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. If the maximum product is **negative** return `-1`.

**Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.**
