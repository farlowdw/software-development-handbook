Given two sparse vectors, compute their dot product.

Implement class `SparseVector`:

- `SparseVector(nums)` Initializes the object with the vector `nums`
- `dotProduct(vec)` Compute the dot product between the instance of SparseVector and `vec`

A **sparse vector** is a vector that has mostly zero values, you should store the sparse vector **efficiently** and compute the dot product between two SparseVector.

**Follow up:** What if only one of the vectors is sparse?
