There is an `m x n` matrix that is initialized to all `0`'s. There is also a 2D array `indices` where each <code>indices[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a **0-indexed location** to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

For each location `indices[i]`, do **both** of the following:

1. Increment all the cells on row <code>r<sub>i</sub></code>.
Increment all the cells on column <code>c<sub>i</sub></code>.

Given `m`, `n`, and `indices`, return the **number of odd-valued cells** in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in `indices`.
