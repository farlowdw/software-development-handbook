There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n` minutes:

- At the first minute, color **any** arbitrary unit cell blue.
- Every minute thereafter, color blue **every** uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.

<div align='center' class='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/2579-f1.png').default} />
</div>

Return the number of **colored cells** at the end of `n` minutes.
