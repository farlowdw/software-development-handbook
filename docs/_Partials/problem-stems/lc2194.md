A cell `(r, c)` of an excel sheet is represented as a string `"<col><row>"` where:

- `<col>` denotes the column number `c` of the cell. It is represented by **alphabetical letters**.
  + For example, the 1st column is denoted by `'A'`, the 2nd by `'B'`, the 3rd by `'C'`, and so on.
- `<row>` is the row number `r` of the cell. The `r`th row is represented by the integer `r`.

You are given a string `s` in the format `"<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>"`, where `<col1>` represents the column `c1`, `<row1>` represents the row `r1`, `<col2>` represents the column `c2`, and `<row2>` represents the row `r2`, such that `r1 <= r2` and `c1 <= c2`.

Return the **list of cells** `(x, y)` such that `r1 <= x <= r2` and `c1 <= y <= c2`. The cells should be represented as **strings** in the format mentioned above and be sorted in **non-decreasing** order first by columns and then by rows.
