You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. The array `arr` is circular. In other words, the first element of the array is the next element of the last element, and the last element of the array is the previous element of the first element.

You can do the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any element from `arr` and increase or decrease it by `1`.

Return the minimum number of operations such that the sum of each **subarray** of length `k` is equal.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.
