There is a 1 million by 1 million grid on an XY-plane, and the coordinates of each grid square are `(x, y)`.

We start at the <code>source = [s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>]</code> square and want to reach the target = [t<sub>x</sub>, t<sub>y</sub>] square. There is also an array of blocked squares, where each <code>blocked[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a blocked square with coordinates <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code>.

Each move, we can walk one square north, east, south, or west if the square is **not** in the array of `blocked` squares. We are also not allowed to walk outside of the grid.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to reach the `target` square from the `source` square through a sequence of valid moves.
