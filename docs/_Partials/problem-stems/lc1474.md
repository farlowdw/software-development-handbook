Given the `head` of a linked list and two integers `m` and `n`. Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:

- Start with the head as the current node.
- Keep the first `m` nodes starting with the current node.
- Remove the next `n` nodes
- Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.

Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

**Follow up question:** How can you solve this problem by modifying the list in-place?
