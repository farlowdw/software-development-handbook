Given a `root` of an [N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/introduction-to-n-ary-trees/), you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of an N-ary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

(Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value.)
