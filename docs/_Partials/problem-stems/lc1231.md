You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array `sweetness`.

You want to share the chocolate with your `K` friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into `K+1` pieces using `K` cuts, each piece consists of some **consecutive** chunks.

Being generous, you will eat the piece with the 8* and give the other pieces to your friends.

Find the **maximum total sweetness** of the piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.
