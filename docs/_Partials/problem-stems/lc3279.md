There are several pistons in an old car engine, and we want to calculate the **maximum** possible area **under** the pistons.

You are given:

- An integer `height`, representing the **maximum** height a piston can reach.
- An integer array `positions`, where `positions[i]` is the current position of piston `i`, which is equal to the current area **under** it.
- A string `directions`, where `directions[i]` is the current moving direction of piston `i`, `'U'` for up, and `'D'` for down.

Each second:

- Every piston moves in its current direction `1` unit. e.g., if the direction is up, `positions[i]` is incremented by `1`.
- If a piston has reached one of the ends, i.e., `positions[i] == 0` or `positions[i] == height`, its direction will change.

Return the maximum possible area under all the pistons.
