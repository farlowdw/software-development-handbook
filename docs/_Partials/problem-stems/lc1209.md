You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal** consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
