Given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n * m`, we define a **0-indexed** 2D matrix `p` of size `n * m` as the **product** matrix of `grid` if the following condition is met:

- Each element `p[i][j]` is calculated as the product of all elements in `grid` except for the element `grid[i][j]`. This product is then taken modulo `12345`.

Return the product matrix of `grid`.
