Given an integer `n`, return a list of all possible **full binary trees** with `n` nodes. Each node of each tree in the answer must have `Node.val == 0`.

Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in **any order**.

A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where each node has exactly `0` or `2` children.
