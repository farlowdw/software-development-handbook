There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Return the **number of valid paths** in the tree.

A path `(a, b)` is **valid** if there exists **exactly one** prime number among the node labels in the path from `a` to `b`.

**Note** that:

- The path `(a, b)` is a sequence of **distinct** nodes starting with node `a` and ending with node `b` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
- Path `(a, b)` and path `(b, a)` are considered the **same** and counted only **once**.
