You are given two strings `start` and `target`, both of length `n`. Each string consists **only** of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'` where:

- The characters `'L'` and `'R'` represent pieces, where a piece `'L'` can move to the **left** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its left, and a piece `'R'` can move to the **right** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its right.
- The character `'_'` represents a blank space that can be occupied by **any** of the 'L' or 'R' pieces.

Return `true` if it is possible to obtain the string `target` by moving the pieces of the string `start` **any** number of times. Otherwise, return `false`.
