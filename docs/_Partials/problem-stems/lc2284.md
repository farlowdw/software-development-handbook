You have a chat log of `n` messages. You are given two string arrays `messages` and `senders` where `messages[i]` is a **message** sent by `senders[i]`.

A **message** is list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. The **word count** of a sender is the total number of **words** sent by the sender. Note that a sender may send more than one message.

Return the sender with the **largest** word count. If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return the one with the **lexicographically largest** name.

**Note:**

- Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters in lexicographical order.
- `"Alice"` and `"alice"` are distinct.
