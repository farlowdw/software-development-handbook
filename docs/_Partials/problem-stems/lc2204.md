You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a **connected undirected graph** containing **exactly one** cycle. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**).

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [node1<sub>i</sub>, node2<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is a **bidirectional** edge connecting <code>node1<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>node2<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.

The distance between two nodes `a` and `b` is defined to be the **minimum** number of edges that are needed to go from `a` to `b`.

Return an integer array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** distance between the `i`th node and **any** node in the cycle.
