Given two arrays of integers `nums` and `index`. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:

- Initially target array is empty.
- From left to right read `nums[i]` and `index[i]`, insert at index `index[i]` the value `nums[i]` in target array.
- Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in `nums` and `index`.

Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.
