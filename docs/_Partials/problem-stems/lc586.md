CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  orders (order_number int, customer_number int, order_date date, required_date date, shipped_date date, status char(15), comment char(200), key(order_number));

Query the `customer_number` from the `orders` table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The `orders` table is defined as follows:

```
| Column            | Type      |
|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |
| order_date        | date      |
| required_date     | date      |
| shipped_date      | date      |
| status            | char(15)  |
| comment           | char(200) |
```

**Sample Input**

```
| order_number | customer_number | order_date | required_date | shipped_date | status | comment |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1            | 1               | 2017-04-09 | 2017-04-13    | 2017-04-12   | Closed |         |
| 2            | 2               | 2017-04-15 | 2017-04-20    | 2017-04-18   | Closed |         |
| 3            | 3               | 2017-04-16 | 2017-04-25    | 2017-04-20   | Closed |         |
| 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |
```

**Sample Output**

```
| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |
```

**Explanation**

- The customer with number '3' has two orders, which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
- So the result is `customer_number` '3'.

**Follow up:** What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

MySQL uses a different expression to get the first records other than MSSQL's `TOP` expression.
