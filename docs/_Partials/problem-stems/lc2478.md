You are given a string `s` that consists of the digits `'1'` to `'9'` and two integers `k` and `minLength`.

A partition of `s` is called **beautiful** if:

- `s` is partitioned into `k` non-intersecting substrings.
- Each substring has a length of **at least** `minLength`.
- Each substring starts with a **prime** digit and ends with a **non-prime** digit. Prime digits are `'2'`, `'3'`, `'5'`, and `'7'`, and the rest of the digits are non-prime.

Return the number of **beautiful** partitions of `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
