There are `m` boys and `n` girls in a class attending an upcoming party.

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where `grid[i][j]` equals `0` or `1`. If `grid[i][j] == 1`, then that means the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> boy can invite the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> girl to the party. A boy can invite at most **one girl**, and a girl can accept at most **one invitation** from a boy.

Return the **maximum** possible number of accepted invitations.
