You have two fruit baskets containing `n` fruits each. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets **equal**. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

- Chose two indices `i` and `j`, and swap the `i`th fruit of `basket1` with the `j`th fruit of `basket2`.
- The cost of the swap is `min(basket1[i],basket2[j])`.

Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or `-1` if impossible.
