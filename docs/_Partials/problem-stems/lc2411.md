You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n`, consisting of non-negative integers. For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, you must determine the size of the **minimum sized** non-empty subarray of `nums` starting at `i` (**inclusive**) that has the **maximum** possible **bitwise OR**.

- In other words, let <code>B<sub>ij</sub></code> be the bitwise OR of the subarray `nums[i...j]`. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at `i`, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to <code>max(B<sub>ik</sub>)</code> where <code>i &lt;= k &lt;= n - 1</code>.

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.

Return an integer array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the length of the **minimum** sized subarray starting at `i` with **maximum** bitwise OR.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
