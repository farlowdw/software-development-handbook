Given strings `A` and `B` of the same length, we say `A[i]` and `B[i]` are equivalent characters. For example, if `A = "abc"` and `B = "cde"`, then we have `'a' == 'c'`, `'b' == 'd'`, `'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

- Reflexivity: `'a' == 'a'`
- Symmetry: `'a' == 'b'` implies `'b' == 'a'`
- Transitivity: `'a' == 'b'` and `'b' == 'c'` implies `'a' == 'c'`

For example, given the equivalency information from `A` and `B` above, `S = "eed"`, `"acd"`, and `"aab"` are equivalent strings, and `"aab"` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S`.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S` by using the equivalency information from `A` and `B`.
