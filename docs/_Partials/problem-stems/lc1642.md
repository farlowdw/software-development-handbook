You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (**0-indexed**),

- If the current building's height is **greater than or equal** to the next building's height, you do **not** need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is **less than** the next building's height, you can either use **one ladder** or (`h[i+1] - h[i]`) **bricks**.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.
