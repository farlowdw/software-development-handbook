There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the **value** of the `i`th node. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges`, where each <code>edges[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>, time<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>, and it takes <code>time<sub>j</sub></code> seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer `maxTime`.

A **valid path** in the graph is any path that starts at node `0`, ends at node `0`, and takes **at most** `maxTime` seconds to complete. You may visit the same node multiple times. The **quality** of a valid path is the **sum** of the values of the **unique nodes** visited in the path (each node's value is added **at most once** to the sum).

Return the **maximum** quality of a valid path.

**Note:** There are **at most four** edges connected to each node.
