Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the **average** of the values in its **subtree**.

**Note:**

- The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.
- A **subtree** of `root` is a tree consisting of `root` and all of its descendants.
