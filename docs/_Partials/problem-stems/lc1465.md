Given a rectangular cake with height `h` and width `w`, and two arrays of integers `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where `horizontalCuts[i]` is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the `i`th horizontal cut and similarly, `verticalCuts[j]` is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the `j`th vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
