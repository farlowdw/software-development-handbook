You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:

- Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the **smallest non-zero** element in `nums`.
- Subtract `x` from every **positive** element in `nums`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make every element in `nums` equal to `0`.
