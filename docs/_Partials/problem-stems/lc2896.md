You are given two **0-indexed** binary strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `n`, and a positive integer `x`.

You can perform any of the following operations on the string `s1` **any** number of times:

- Choose two indices `i` and `j`, and flip both `s1[i]` and `s1[j]`. The cost of this operation is `x`.
- Choose an index `i` such that `i < n - 1` and flip both `s1[i]` and `s1[i + 1]`. The cost of this operation is `1`.

Return the **minimum** cost needed to make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal, or return `-1` if it is impossible.

**Note** that flipping a character means changing it from `0` to `1` or vice-versa.
