You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `receiver` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

There are `n` players having a **unique id** in the range `[0, n - 1]` who will play a ball passing game, and `receiver[i]` is the id of the player who receives passes from the player with id `i`. Players can pass to themselves, i.e. `receiver[i]` may be equal to `i`.

You must choose one of the `n` players as the starting player for the game, and the ball will be passed **exactly** `k` times starting from the chosen player.

For a chosen starting player having id `x`, we define a function `f(x)` that denotes the **sum** of `x` and the **ids** of all players who receive the ball during the `k` passes, **including repetitions**. In other words, <code>f(x) = x + receiver[x] + receiver[receiver[x]] + ... + receiver<sup>(k)</sup>[x]</code>. 

Your task is to choose a starting player having id `x` that **maximizes** the value of `f(x)`.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** value of the function.

**Note:** `receiver` may contain duplicates.
