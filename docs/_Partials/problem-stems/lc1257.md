You are given some lists of `regions` where the first region of each list includes all other regions in that list.

Naturally, if a region `X` contains another region `Y` then `X` is bigger than `Y`. Also by definition a region `X` contains itself.

Given two regions `region1`, `region2`, find out the **smallest** region that contains both of them.

If you are given regions `r1`, `r2` and `r3` such that `r1` includes `r3`, it is guaranteed there is no `r2` such that `r2` includes `r3`.

It's guaranteed the smallest region exists.
