Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a continuous subarray of size **at least two** whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, or `false` otherwise.

An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is always a multiple of `k`.
