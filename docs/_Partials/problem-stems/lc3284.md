We call an array `arr` of length `n` **consecutive** if one of the following holds:

- `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 1` for all `1 <= i < n`.
- `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == -1` for all `1 <= i < n`.

The **value** of an array is the sum of its elements.

For example, `[3, 4, 5]` is a consecutive array of value `12` and `[9, 8]` is another of value `17`. While `[3, 4, 3]` and `[8, 6]` are not consecutive.

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the sum of the **values** of all **consecutive** subarrays.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that an array of length `1` is also considered consecutive.
