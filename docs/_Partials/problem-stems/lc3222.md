You are given two **positive** integers `x` and `y`, denoting the number of coins with values `75` and `10` respectively.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each turn, starting with **Alice**, the player must pick up coins with a **total** value `115`. If the player is unable to do so, they **lose** the game.

Return the name of the player who wins the game if both players play **optimally**.
