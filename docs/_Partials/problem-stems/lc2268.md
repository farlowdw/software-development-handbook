You have a keypad with `9` buttons, numbered from `1` to `9`, each mapped to lowercase English letters. You can choose which characters each button is matched to as long as:

- All 26 lowercase English letters are mapped to.
- Each character is mapped to by **exactly** `1` button.
- Each button maps to **at most** `3` characters.

To type the first character matched to a button, you press the button once. To type the second character, you press the button twice, and so on.

Given a string `s`, return the **minimum** number of keypresses needed to type `s` using your keypad.

**Note** that the characters mapped to by each button, and the order they are mapped in cannot be changed.
