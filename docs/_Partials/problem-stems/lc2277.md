You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [node1<sub>i</sub>, node2<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is a **bidirectional** edge connecting <code>node1<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>node2<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `query` of length `m` where <code>query[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, node<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that for the `i`th query, you are tasked with finding the node on the path from <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> that is closest to <code>node<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return an integer array `answer` of length `m`, where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.
