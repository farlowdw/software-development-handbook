We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where <code>requests[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents an employee's request to transfer from building <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to building <code>to<sub>i</sub></code>.

**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return the maximum number of achievable requests.
