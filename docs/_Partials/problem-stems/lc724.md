Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the **pivot index** of this array.

The **pivot index** is the index where the sum of all the numbers **strictly** to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers **strictly** to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is `0` because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the **leftmost pivot index**. If no such index exists, return `-1`.
