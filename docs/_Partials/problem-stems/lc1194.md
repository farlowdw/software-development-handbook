**Table:** `Players`

```
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
```

- `player_id` is the primary key of this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.

**Table:** `Matches`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

- `match_id` is the primary key of this table.
- Each row is a record of a match, `first_player` and `second_player` contain the `player_id` of each match.
- `first_score` and `second_score` contain the number of points of the `first_player` and `second_player` respectively.
- You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.

The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the **lowest** `player_id` wins.

Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Players table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |
| 25        | 1          |
| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
| 35        | 2          |
| 50        | 2          |
| 20        | 3          |
| 40        | 3          |
+-----------+------------+

Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | first_player | second_player | first_score | second_score |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 15           | 45            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 25            | 1           | 2            |
| 3          | 30           | 15            | 2           | 0            |
| 4          | 40           | 20            | 5           | 2            |
| 5          | 35           | 50            | 1           | 1            |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+
| group_id  | player_id  |
+-----------+------------+ 
| 1         | 15         |
| 2         | 35         |
| 3         | 40         |
+-----------+------------+
