You are given an even integer `n` representing the number of houses arranged in a straight line, and a 2D array `cost` of size `n x 3`, where `cost[i][j]` represents the cost of painting house `i` with color `j + 1`.

The houses will look **beautiful** if they satisfy the following conditions:

- No two adjacent houses are painted the same color.
- Houses equidistant from the ends of the row are not painted the same color. For example, if `n = 6`, houses at positions `(0, 5)`, `(1, 4)`, and `(2, 3)` are considered equidistant.

Return the minimum cost to paint the houses such that they look beautiful.
