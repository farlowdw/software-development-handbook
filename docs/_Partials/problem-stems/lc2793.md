You are given a `root` to a binary tree and an integer `k`. A node of this tree is called **great enough** if the followings hold:

- Its subtree has **at least** `k` nodes.
- Its value is **greater** than the value of **at least** `k` nodes in its subtree.

Return the number of nodes in this tree that are great enough.

The node `u` is in the **subtree** of the node `v`, if `u == v` or `v` is an ancestor of `u`.
