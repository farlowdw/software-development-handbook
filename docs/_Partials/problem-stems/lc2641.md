Given the `root` of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the **sum of all its cousins' values**.

Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.

Return the `root` of the modified tree.

**Note** that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.
