You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`.

A substring of `s` is **beautiful** if the number of `1`'s in it is exactly `k`.

Let `len` be the length of the **shortest** beautiful substring.

Return the lexicographically **smallest** beautiful substring of string `s` with length equal to `len`. If `s` doesn't contain a beautiful substring, return an **empty** string.

A string `a` is lexicographically **larger** than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`.

- For example, `"abcd"` is lexicographically larger than `"abcc"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.
