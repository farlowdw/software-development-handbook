There is a sale in a supermarket, there will be a `discount` every `n` customer. There are some products in the supermarket where the id of the `i`th product is `products[i]` and the price per unit of this product is `prices[i]`. The system will count the number of customers and when the `n`th customer arrive he/she will have a `discount` on the bill. (i.e, if the cost is `x` the new cost is `x - (discount * x) / 100`). Then the system will start counting customers again. The customer orders a certain amount of each product where `product[i]` is the id of the `i`th product the customer ordered and `amount[i]` is the number of units the customer ordered of that product.

Implement the `Cashier` class:

- `Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)` Initializes the object with `n`, the `discount`, the `products` and their `prices`.
- `double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)` returns the value of the bill and apply the discount if needed. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
