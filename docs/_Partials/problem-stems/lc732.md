A `k`-booking happens when `k` events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., there is some time that is common to all `k` events.)

You are given some events `[start, end)`, after each given event, return an integer `k` representing the maximum k-booking between all the previous events.

Implement the `MyCalendarThree` class:

- `MyCalendarThree()` Initializes the object.
- `int book(int start, int end)` Returns an integer `k` representing the largest integer such that there exists a `k`-booking in the calendar.
