Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list answer of size `2` where:

- `answer[0]` is a list of all **distinct** integers in `nums1` which are **not** present in `nums2`.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all **distinct** integers in `nums2` which are **not** present in `nums1`.

**Note** that the integers in the lists may be returned in **any** order.
