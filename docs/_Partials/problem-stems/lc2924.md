There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a tournament; each team is also a node in a **DAG**.

You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of length `m` representing the **DAG**, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a directed edge from team <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to team <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.

A directed edge from `a` to `b` in the graph means that team `a` is **stronger** than team `b` and team `b` is **weaker** than team `a`.

Team `a` will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is no team `b` that is **stronger** than team `a`.

Return the team that will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is a **unique** champion, otherwise, return `-1`.

**Notes**

- A **cycle** is a series of nodes <code>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, a<sub>n+1</sub></code> such that node <code>a<sub>1</sub></code> is the same node as node <code>a<sub>n+1</sub></code>, the nodes <code>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></code> are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>a<sub>i+1</sub></code> for every `i` in the range `[1, n]`.
- A **DAG** is a directed graph that does not have any **cycle**.
