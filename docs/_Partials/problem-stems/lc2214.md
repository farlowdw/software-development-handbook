You are playing a game that has n levels numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `damage` where `damage[i]` is the amount of health you will lose to complete the `i`th level.

You are also given an integer `armor`. You may use your armor ability **at most once** during the game on **any** level which will protect you from **at most** `armor` damage.

You must complete the levels in order and your health must be **greater than** `0` at all times to beat the game.

Return the **minimum** health you need to start with to beat the game.
