A string can be **abbreviated** by replacing any number of **non-adjacent** substrings with their lengths. For example, a string such as `"substitution"` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):

- `"s10n"` (<code>"s <u>ubstitutio</u> n"</code>)
- `"sub4u4"` (<code>"sub <u>stit</u> u <u>tion</u>"</code>)
- `"12"` (<code>"<u>substitution</u>"</code>)
- `"su3i1u2on"` (<code>"su <u>bst</u> i <u>t</u> u <u>ti</u> on"</code>)
- `"substitution"` (no substrings replaced)

Note that `"s55n"` (<code>"s <u>ubsti</u> tutio <u>n</u>"</code>) is not a valid abbreviation of `"substitution"` because the replaced substrings are adjacent.

The **length** of an abbreviation is the number of letters that were not replaced plus the number of substrings that were replaced. For example, the abbreviation `"s10n"` has a length of `3` (`2` letters + `1` substring) and `"su3i1u2on"` has a length of `9` (`6` letters + `3` substrings).

Given a target string `target` and an array of strings `dictionary`, return an **abbreviation** of `target` with the **shortest possible length** such that it is **not an abbreviation** of **any** string in `dictionary`. If there are multiple shortest abbreviations, return any of them.
