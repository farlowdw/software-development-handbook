Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the **smallest** subarray (possibly **empty**) such that the **sum** of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is **not** allowed to remove the whole array.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or `-1` if it's impossible.

A **subarray** is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.
