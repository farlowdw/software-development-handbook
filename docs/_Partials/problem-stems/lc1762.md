There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.

Return a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.
