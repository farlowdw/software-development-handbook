You are given an `m x n` matrix maze (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where <code>entrance = [entrance<sub>row</sub>, entrance<sub>col</sub>]</code> denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the `entrance`. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count** as an exit.

Return the **number of steps** in the shortest path from the `entrance` to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists.
