There exists an infinitely large grid. You are currently at point `(1, 1)`, and you need to reach the point `(targetX, targetY)` using a finite number of steps.

In one **step**, you can move from point `(x, y)` to any one of the following points:

- `(x, y - x)`
- `(x - y, y)`
- `(2 * x, y)`
- `(x, 2 * y)`

Given two integers `targetX` and `targetY` representing the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of your final position, return `true` if you can reach the point from `(1, 1)` using some number of steps, and `false` otherwise.
