You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The numbers from `0` to `n - 1` are divided into three groups numbered from `1` to `3`, where number `i` belongs to group `nums[i]`. Notice that some groups may be **empty**.

You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times:

- Pick number `x` and change its group. More formally, change `nums[x]` to any number from `1` to `3`.

A new array `res` is constructed using the following procedure:

1. Sort the numbers in each group independently.
2. Append the elements of groups `1`, `2`, and `3` to `res` **in this order**.

Array `nums` is called a **beautiful array** if the constructed array `res` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make `nums` a **beautiful array**.
