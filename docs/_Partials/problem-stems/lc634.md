In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of `n` integers from `1` to `n` in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
