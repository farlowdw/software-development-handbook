Given the strings `s1` and `s2` of size `n` and the string `evil`, return the number of **good** strings.

A **good** string has size `n`, it is alphabetically greater than or equal to `s1`, it is alphabetically smaller than or equal to `s2`, and it does not contain the string `evil` as a substring. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
