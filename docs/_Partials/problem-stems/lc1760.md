You are given an integer array `nums` where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a **positive** number of balls.
  + For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.

Your penalty is the **maximum** number of balls in a bag. You want to **minimize** your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
