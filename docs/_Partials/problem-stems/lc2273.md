You are given a **0-indexed** string array `words`, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, select any index `i` such that `0 < i < words.length` and `words[i - 1]` and `words[i]` are **anagrams**, and **delete** `words[i]` from `words`. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return `words` after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, `"dacb"` is an anagram of `"abdc"`.
