You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and an integer `multiplier`.

You need to perform `k` operations on `nums`. In each operation:

- Find the **minimum** value `x` in `nums`. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears `first`.
- Replace the selected minimum value `x` with `x * multiplier`.

After the `k` operations, apply **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code> to every value in `nums`.

Return an integer array denoting the final state of `nums` after performing all `k` operations and then applying the modulo.
