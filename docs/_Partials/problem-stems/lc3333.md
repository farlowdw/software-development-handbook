Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and **may** press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed **multiple** times.

You are given a string `word`, which represents the **final** output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a **positive** integer `k`.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size **at least** `k`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
