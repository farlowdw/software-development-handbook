In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at **every** integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate `(i, j)` has `|i| + |j|` apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned **square plot** of land that is centered at `(0, 0)`.

Given an integer `neededApples`, return the **minimum perimeter** of a plot such that **at least** `neededApples` apples are **inside or on** the perimeter of that plot.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

- `x` if `x >= 0`
- `-x` if `x < 0`
