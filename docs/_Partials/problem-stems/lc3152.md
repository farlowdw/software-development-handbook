An array is considered **special** if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer `nums` and a 2D integer matrix `queries`, where for <code>queries[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> your task is to check that subarray <code>nums[from<sub>i</sub>..to<sub>i</sub>]</code> is **special** or not.

Return an array of booleans `answer` such that `answer[i]` is `true` if <code>nums[from<sub>i</sub>..to<sub>i</sub>]</code> is special.
