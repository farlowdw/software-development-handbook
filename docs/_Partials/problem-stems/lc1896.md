You are given a **valid** boolean expression as a string `expression` consisting of the characters `'1'`, `'0'`, `'&'` (bitwise **AND** operator), `'|'` (bitwise **OR** operator), `'('`, and `')'`.

- For example, `"()1|1"` and `"(1)&()"` are **not valid** while `"1"`, `"(((1))|(0))"`, and `"1|(0&(1))"` are **valid** expressions.

Return the **minimum cost** to change the final value of the expression.

- For example, if `expression = "1|1|(0&0)&1"`, its **value** is `1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1`. We want to apply operations so that the **new** expression evaluates to `0`.

The **cost** of changing the final value of an expression is the **number of operations** performed on the expression. The types of **operations** are described as follows:

- Turn a `'1'` into a `'0'`.
- Turn a `'0'` into a `'1'`.
- Turn a `'&'` into a `'|'`.
- Turn a `'|'` into a `'&'`.

**Note:** `'&'` does **not** take precedence over `'|'` in the **order of calculation**. Evaluate parentheses **first**, then in **left-to-right** order.
