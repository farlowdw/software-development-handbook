You are given a 2D `matrix` of size `m x n`, consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given an integer `k`.

The **value** of coordinate `(a, b)` of the matrix is the XOR of all `matrix[i][j]` where `0 <= i <= a < m` and `0 <= j <= b < n` **(0-indexed)**.

Find the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> largest value **(1-indexed)** of all the coordinates of `matrix`.
