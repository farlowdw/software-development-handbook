There are `n` people and `40` types of hats labeled from `1` to `40`.

Given a list of list of integers hats, where `hats[i]` is a list of all hats preferred by the `i`th person.

Return the number of ways that the `n` people wear different hats to each other.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
