You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a letter `letter`, and an integer `repetition`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** subsequence of `s` of length `k` that has the letter `letter` appear **at least** `repetition` times. The test cases are generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` **at least** `repetition` times.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.
