You are given an integer array `nums`.

The **factor score** of an array is defined as the product of the LCM and GCD of all elements of that array.

Return the **maximum factor score** of `nums` after removing **at most** one element from it.

**Note** that both the LCM and GCD of a single number are the number itself, and the factor score of an **empty** array is `0`.
