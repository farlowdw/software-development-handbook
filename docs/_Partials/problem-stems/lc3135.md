Given two strings `initial` and `target`, your task is to modify `initial` by performing a series of operations to make it equal to `target`.

In one operation, you can add or remove **one character** only at the beginning or the end of the string `initial`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `initial` into `target`.
