A **value-equal** string is a string where **all** characters are the same.

- For example, `"1111"` and `"33"` are value-equal strings.
- In contrast, `"123"` is not a value-equal string.

Given a digit string `s`, decompose the string into some number of **consecutive value-equal** substrings where **exactly one** substring has a **length of** `2` and the remaining substrings have a **length of** `3`.

Return `true` if you can decompose `s` according to the above rules. Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
