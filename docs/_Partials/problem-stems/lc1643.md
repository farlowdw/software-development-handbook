Bob is standing at cell `(0, 0)`, and he wants to reach `destination`: `(row, column)`. He can only travel **right** and **down**. You are going to help Bob by providing **instructions** for him to reach `destination`.

The **instructions** are represented as a string, where each character is either:

- `'H'`, meaning move horizontally (go **right**), or
- `'V'`, meaning move vertically (go **down**).

Multiple **instructions** will lead Bob to `destination`. For example, if `destination` is `(2, 3)`, both `"HHHVV"` and `"HVHVH"` are valid **instructions**.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number `k`, and he wants the `k`th **lexicographically smallest instructions** that will lead him to `destination`. `k` is **1-indexed**.

Given an integer array `destination` and an integer `k`, return the `k`th **lexicographically smallest instructions** that will take Bob to `destination`.
