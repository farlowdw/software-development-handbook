You are given a string `s` consisting only of digits. A **valid pair** is defined as two **adjacent** digits in `s` such that:

- The first digit is **not equal** to the second.
- Each digit in the pair appears in `s` **exactly** as many times as its numeric value.

Return the first **valid pair** found in the string `s` when traversing from left to right. If no valid pair exists, return an empty string.
