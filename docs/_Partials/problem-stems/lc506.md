You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> place athlete has the highest score, the <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> place athlete has the <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

- The <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
- The <code>2<sup>nd</sup></code> place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
- The <code>3<sup>rd</sup></code> place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
- For the <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> place to the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> athlete.
