There exist two **undirected** trees with `n` and `m` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and from `0` to `m - 1`, respectively. You are given two 2D integer arrays `edges1` and `edges2` of lengths `n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively, where <code>edges1[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the first tree and <code>edges2[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the second tree.

You must connect one node from the first tree with another node from the second tree with an edge.

Return the **minimum** possible **diameter** of the resulting tree.

The **diameter** of a tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
