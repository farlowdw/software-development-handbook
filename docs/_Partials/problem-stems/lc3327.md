You are given a tree rooted at node `0`, consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by an array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Consider an empty string `dfsStr`, and define a recursive function `dfs(int x)` that takes a node `x` as a parameter and performs the following steps in order:

- Iterate over each child `y` of `x` **in increasing order of their numbers**, and call `dfs(y)`.
- Add the character `s[x]` to the end of the string `dfsStr`.

**Note** that `dfsStr` is shared across all recursive calls of `dfs`.

You need to find a boolean array `answer` of size `n`, where for each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, you do the following:

- Empty the string `dfsStr` and call `dfs(i)`.
- If the resulting string `dfsStr` is a palindrome, then set `answer[i]` to `true`. Otherwise, set `answer[i]` to `false`.

Return the array `answer`.
