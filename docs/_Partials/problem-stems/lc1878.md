You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`.

A **rhombus sum** is the sum of the elements that form **the border** of a regular rhombus shape in `grid`. The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners centered in a grid cell. Below is an image of four valid rhombus shapes with the corresponding colored cells that should be included in each **rhombus sum**:

</p>

Note that the rhombus can have an area of `0`, which is depicted by the purple rhombus in the bottom right corner.

Return the biggest three **distinct rhombus sums** in the `grid` in **descending order**. If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them.
