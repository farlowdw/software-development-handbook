You are given a string `s` and a robot that currently holds an empty string `t`. Apply one of the following operations until `s` and `t` **are both empty**:

- Remove the **first** character of a string `s` and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string `t`.
- Remove the **last** character of a string `t` and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.
