There is a survey that consists of `n` questions where each question's answer is either `0` (no) or `1` (yes).

The survey was given to `m` students numbered from `0` to `m - 1` and `m` mentors numbered from `0` to `m - 1`. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array `students` where `students[i]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `i`th student (**0-indexed**). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array `mentors` where `mentors[j]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the `j`th mentor (**0-indexed**).

Each student will be assigned to **one** mentor, and each mentor will have **one** student assigned to them. The **compatibility score** of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

- For example, if the student's answers were <code>[1, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>]</code> and the mentor's answers were <code>[0, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>]</code>, then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to **maximize** the **sum of the compatibility scores**.

Given `students` and `mentors`, return the **maximum compatibility score sum** that can be achieved.
