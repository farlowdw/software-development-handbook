Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n`, respectively. You may assume that `nums1` has a size equal to `m + n` such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from `nums2`.
