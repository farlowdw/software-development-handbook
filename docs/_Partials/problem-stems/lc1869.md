Given a binary string `s`, return `true` if the **longest** contiguous segment of `1`s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous segment of `0`s in `s`. Return `false` otherwise.

For example, in <code>s = "<u>11</u>01<u>000</u>10"</code> the longest contiguous segment of `1`s has length `2`, and the longest contiguous segment of `0`s has length `3`.

Note that if there are no `0`s, then the longest contiguous segment of `0`s is considered to have length `0`. The same applies if there are no `1`s.
