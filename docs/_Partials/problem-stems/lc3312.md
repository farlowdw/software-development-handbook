You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer array `queries`.

Let `gcdPairs` denote an array obtained by calculating the GCD of all possible pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where `0 <= i < j < n`, and then sorting these values in **ascending** order.

For each query `queries[i]`, you need to find the element at index `queries[i]` in `gcdPairs`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the value at `gcdPairs[queries[i]]` for each query.

The term `gcd(a, b)` denotes the **greatest common divisor** of `a` and `b`.
