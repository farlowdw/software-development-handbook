You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of non-negative integers, and two integers `l` and `r`.

Return the **count of sub-multisets** within `nums` where the sum of elements in each subset falls within the inclusive range of `[l, r]`.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A **sub-multiset** is an **unordered** collection of elements of the array in which a given value `x` can occur `0, 1, ..., occ[x]` times, where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the array.

**Note** that:

- Two **sub-multisets** are the same if sorting both sub-multisets results in identical multisets.
- The sum of an **empty** multiset is `0`.
