Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `True` if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you've previously visited. Return `False` otherwise.
