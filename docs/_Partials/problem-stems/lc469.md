You are given an array of points on the **X-Y** plane `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The points form a polygon when joined sequentially.

Return `true` if this polygon is [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon) and `false` otherwise.

You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a [simple polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
