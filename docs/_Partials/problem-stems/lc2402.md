You are given an integer `n`. There are `n` rooms numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `meetings` where <code>meetings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time interval <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>. All the values of <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> are **unique**.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

1. Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the **lowest** number.
2. If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the **same** duration as the original meeting.
3. When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.

Return the **number** of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the **lowest** number.

A **half-closed interval** `[a, b)` is the interval between `a` and `b` **including** `a` and **not including** `b`.
