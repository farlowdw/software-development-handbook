A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106"` can be mapped into:

- `"AAJF"` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
- `"KJF"` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6"` is different from `"06"`.

**In addition** to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `"1*"` may represent any of the encoded messages `"11"`, `"12"`, `"13"`, `"14"`, `"15"`, `"16"`, `"17"`, `"18"`, or `"19"`. Decoding `"1*"` is equivalent to decoding **any** of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string `s` containing digits and the `'*'` character, return the **number** of ways to **decode** it.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
