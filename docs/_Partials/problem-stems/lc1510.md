Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.
