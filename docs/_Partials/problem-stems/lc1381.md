Design a stack which supports the following operations.

Implement the `CustomStack` class:

- `CustomStack(int maxSize)` Initializes the object with `maxSize` which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the `maxSize`.
- `void push(int x)` Adds `x` to the top of the stack if the stack hasn't reached the `maxSize`.
- `int pop()` Pops and returns the top of stack or `-1` if the stack is empty.
- `void inc(int k, int val)` Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by `val`. If there are less than `k` elements in the stack, just increment all the elements in the stack.
