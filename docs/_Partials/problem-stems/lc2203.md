You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>.

Lastly, you are given three **distinct** integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return the **minimum weight** of a subgraph of the graph such that it is **possible** to reach `dest` from both `src1` and `src2` via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.

A **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The **weight** of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.
