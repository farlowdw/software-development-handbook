There are `n` mountains in a row, and each mountain has a height. You are given an integer array `height` where `height[i]` represents the height of mountain `i`, and an integer `threshold`.

A mountain is called **stable** if the mountain just before it (**if it exists**) has a height **strictly greater** than `threshold`. **Note** that mountain `0` is **not** stable.

Return an array containing the indices of all **stable** mountains in **any** order.
