There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `paint` of length `n`, where <code>paint[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code>. This means that on the `i`th day you need to paint the area between <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>end<sub>i</sub></code>.

Painting the same area multiple times will create an uneven painting so you only want to paint each area of the painting at most **once**.

Return an integer array `worklog` of length `n`, where `worklog[i]` is the amount of **new** area that you painted on the `i`th day.
