You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `limit` and `goal`. The array `nums` has an interesting property that `abs(nums[i]) <= limit`.

Return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to `goal`. The array must maintain its property that `abs(nums[i]) <= limit`.

Note that `abs(x)` equals `x` if `x >= 0`, and `-x` otherwise.
