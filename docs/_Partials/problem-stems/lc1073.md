Given two numbers `arr1` and `arr2` in base `-2`, return the result of adding them together.

Each number is given in array format:  as an array of `0`s and `1`s, from most significant bit to least significant bit.  For example, `arr = [1,1,0,1]` represents the number `(-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3`.  A number `arr` in array, format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either `arr == [0]` or `arr[0] == 1`.

Return the result of adding `arr1` and `arr2` in the same format: as an array of `0`s and `1`s with no leading zeros.
