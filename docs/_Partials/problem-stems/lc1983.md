You are given two **0-indexed** binary arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. Find the **widest** pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i <= j` and `nums1[i] + nums1[i+1] + ... + nums1[j] == nums2[i] + nums2[i+1] + ... + nums2[j]`.

The **widest** pair of indices is the pair with the **largest distance** between `i` and `j`. The **distance** between a pair of indices is defined as `j - i + 1`.

Return the **distance** of the **widest** pair of indices. If no pair of indices meets the conditions, return `0`.
