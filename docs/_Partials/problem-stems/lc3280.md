You are given a string `date` representing a Gregorian calendar date in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

`date` can be written in its binary representation obtained by converting year, month, and day to their binary representations without any leading zeroes and writing them down in `year-month-day` format.

Return the **binary** representation of `date`.
