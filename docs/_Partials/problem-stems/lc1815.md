There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of `batchSize`. They have a rule where they must serve **all** of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchSize` and an integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` denotes that there is a group of `groups[i]` customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.

When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.

You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return the **maximum** possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.
