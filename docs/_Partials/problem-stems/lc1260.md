Given a 2D grid of size `m x n` and an integer `k`. You need to shift the grid `k` times.

In one shift operation:

- Element at `grid[i][j]` moves to `grid[i][j + 1]`.
- Element at `grid[i][n - 1]` moves to `grid[i + 1][0]`.
- Element at `grid[m - 1][n - 1]` moves to `grid[0][0]`.

Return the 2D grid after applying shift operation `k` times.
