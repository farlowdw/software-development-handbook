You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n` containing **distinct** positive integers. Return the **minimum** number of **right shifts** required to sort `nums` and `-1` if this is not possible.

A **right shift** is defined as shifting the element at index `i` to index `(i + 1) % n`, for all indices.
