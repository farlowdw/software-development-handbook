Bob is stuck in a dungeon and must break `n` locks, each requiring some amount of **energy** to break. The required energy for each lock is stored in an array called `strength` where `strength[i]` indicates the energy needed to break the `i`th lock.

To break a lock, Bob uses a sword with the following characteristics:

- The initial energy of the sword is `0`.
- The initial factor `X` by which the energy of the sword increases is `1`.
- Every minute, the energy of the sword increases by the current factor `X`.
- To break the `i`th lock, the energy of the sword must reach at least `strength[i]`.
- After breaking a lock, the energy of the sword resets to `0`, and the factor `X` increases by a given value `K`.

Your task is to determine the **minimum** time in minutes required for Bob to break all `n` locks and escape the dungeon.

Return the **minimum** time required for Bob to break all `n` locks.
