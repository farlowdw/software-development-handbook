Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return the number of **distinct prime factors** in the product of the elements of `nums`.

**Note** that:

- A number greater than `1` is called **prime** if it is divisible by only `1` and itself.
- An integer `val1` is a factor of another integer `val2` if `val2 / val1` is an integer.
