**Table:** `Trips`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Id          | int      |
| Client_Id   | int      |
| Driver_Id   | int      |
| City_Id     | int      |
| Status      | enum     |
| Request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
```

- `Id` is the primary key for this table.
- The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique `Id`, while `Client_Id` and `Driver_Id` are foreign keys to the `Users_Id` at the `Users` table.
- `Status` is an `ENUM` type of `('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client')`.

**Table:** `Users`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Users_Id    | int      |
| Banned      | enum     |
| Role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
```

- `Users_Id` is the primary key for this table.
- The table holds all users. Each user has a unique `Users_Id`, and `Role` is an `ENUM` type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').
- `Status` is an `ENUM` type of `('Yes', 'No')`.

Write a SQL query to find the **cancellation rate** of requests with unbanned users (**both client and driver must not be banned**) each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`.

The **cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round `Cancellation Rate` to **two decimal** points.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Trips table:
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+

| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |

```

- On `2013-10-01`:
  + There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  + However, the request with `Id=2` was made by a banned client (`User_Id=2`), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  + Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  + The Cancellation Rate is `(1 / 3) = 0.33`
- On `2013-10-02`:
  + There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  + The request with `Id=6` was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  + Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  + The Cancellation Rate is `(0 / 2) = 0.00`
- On `2013-10-03`:
  + There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  + The request with `Id=8` was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  + Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  + The Cancellation Rate is `(1 / 2) = 0.50`
