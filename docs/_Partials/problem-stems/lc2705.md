Given an object or array `obj`, return a **compact object**. A **compact object** is the same as the original object, except with keys containing **falsy** values removed. This operation applies to the object and any nested objects. Arrays are considered objects where the indices are keys. A value is considered **falsy** when `Boolean(value)` returns `false`.

You may assume the `obj` is the output of `JSON.parse`. In other words, it is valid JSON.
