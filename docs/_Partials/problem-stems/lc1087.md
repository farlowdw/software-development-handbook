You are given a string `s` representing a list of words. Each letter in the word has one or more options.

- If there is one option, the letter is represented as is.
- If there is more than one option, then curly braces delimit the options. For example, `"{a,b,c}"` represents options `["a", "b", "c"]`.

For example, if `s = "a{b,c}"`, the first character is always `'a'`, but the second character can be `'b'` or `'c'`. The original list is `["ab", "ac"]`.

Return all words that can be formed in this manner, **sorted** in lexicographical order.
