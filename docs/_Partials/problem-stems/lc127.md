A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words such that:

- The first word in the sequence is `beginWord`.
- The last word in the sequence is `endWord`.
- Only one letter is different between each adjacent pair of words in the sequence.
- Every word in the sequence is in `wordList`.

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from `beginWord` to endWord, or `0` if no such sequence exists.
