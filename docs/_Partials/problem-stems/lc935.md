The chess knight has a **unique movement**, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an **L**). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).

</p>

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
