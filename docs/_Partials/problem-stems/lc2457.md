You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.

An integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`.

Return the minimum **non-negative** integer `x` such that `n + x` is beautiful. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.
