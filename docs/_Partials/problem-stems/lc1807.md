You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a **non-empty** key.

- For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each <code>knowledge[i] = [key<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that key <code>key<sub>i</sub></code> has a value of <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are tasked to evaluate **all** of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key <code>key<sub>i</sub></code>, you will:

- Replace <code>key<sub>i</sub></code> and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>.
- If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace <code>key<sub>i</sub></code> and the bracket pair with a question mark "?" (without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return the resulting string after evaluating **all** of the bracket pairs.
