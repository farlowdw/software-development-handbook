A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word can contain digits, lowercase letters, and the dollar sign `'$'`. A word represents a **price** if it is a non-negative real number preceded by a dollar sign.

- For example, `"$100"`, `"$23"`, and `"$6.75"` represent prices while `"100"`, `"$"`, and `"2$3"` do not.

You are given a string `sentence` representing a sentence and an integer `discount`. For each word representing a price, apply a discount of `discount%` on the price and **update** the word in the sentence. All updated prices should be represented with **exactly two** decimal places.

Return a string representing the modified sentence.
