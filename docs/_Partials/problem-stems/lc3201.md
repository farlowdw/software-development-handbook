You are given an integer array `nums`.

A subsequence `sub` of `nums` with length `x` is called **valid** if it satisfies:

- `(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2`

Return the length of the **longest valid** subsequence of `nums`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
