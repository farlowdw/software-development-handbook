By now, you are given a **secret signature** consisting of character `'D'` and `'I'`. `'D'` represents a decreasing relationship between two numbers, `'I'` represents an increasing relationship between two numbers. And our **secret signature** was constructed by a special integer array, which contains uniquely all the different number from `1` to `n` (`n` is the length of the secret signature plus `1`). For example, the secret signature `"DI"` can be constructed by array `[2,1,3]` or `[3,1,2]`, but won't be constructed by array `[3,2,4]` or `[2,1,3,4]`, which are both illegal constructing special string that can't represent the `"DI"` **secret signature**.

On the other hand, now your job is to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of `[1, 2, ... n]` could refer to the given **secret signature** in the input.
