You are given a positive integer `n` representing n cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with a distance equal to <code>distance<sub>i</sub></code>. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The **score** of a path between two cities is defined as the **minimum** distance of a road in this path.

Return the **minimum** possible score of a path between cities `1` and `n`.

**Note:**

- A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
- It is allowed for a path to contain the same road **multiple** times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
- The test cases are generated such that there is **at least** one path between `1` and `n`.
