There are `n` points on an infinite plane. You are given two integer arrays `xCoord` and `yCoord` where `(xCoord[i], yCoord[i])` represents the coordinates of the `i`th point.

Your task is to find the **maximum** area of a rectangle that:

- Can be formed using **four** of these points as its corners.
- Does **not** contain any other point inside or on its border.
- Has its edges **parallel** to the axes.

Return the **maximum area** that you can obtain or `-1` if no such rectangle is possible.
