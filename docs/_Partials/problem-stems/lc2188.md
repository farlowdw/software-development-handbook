You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `tires` where <code>tires[i] = [f<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the `i`th tire can finish its `x`th successive lap in <code>f<sub>i</sub> * r<sub>i</sub><sup>(x-1)</sup></code> seconds.

- For example, if <code>f<sub>i</sub> = 3</code> and <code>r<sub>i</sub> = 2</code>, then the tire would finish its 1st lap in `3` seconds, its 2nd lap in `3 * 2 = 6` seconds, its 3rd lap in `3 * 22 = 12` seconds, etc.

You are also given an integer `changeTime` and an integer `numLaps`.

The race consists of `numLaps` laps and you may start the race with **any** tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap, you may **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait `changeTime` seconds.

Return the **minimum** time to finish the race.
