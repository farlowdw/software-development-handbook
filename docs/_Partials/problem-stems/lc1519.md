Given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. The **root** of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has **a label** which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The `edges` array is given on the form <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>, which means there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Return an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `i`th node which have the same label as node `i`.

A subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.
