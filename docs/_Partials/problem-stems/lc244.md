Design a data structure that will be initialized with a string array, and then it should answer queries of the shortest distance between two different strings from the array.

Implement the `WordDistance` class:

- `WordDistance(String[] wordsDict)` initializes the object with the strings array `wordsDict`.
- `int shortest(String word1, String word2)` returns the shortest distance between `word1` and `word2` in the array `wordsDict`.
