Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return the most **competitive** subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more **competitive** than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number **less** than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[1,3,4]` is more competitive than `[1,3,5]` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and `4` is less than `5`.
