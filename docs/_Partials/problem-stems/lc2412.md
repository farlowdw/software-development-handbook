You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `transactions`, where <code>transactions[i] = [cost<sub>i</sub>, cashback<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The array describes transactions, where each transaction must be completed exactly once in **some order**. At any given moment, you have a certain amount of `money`. In order to complete transaction `i`, <code>money >= cost<sub>i</sub></code> must hold true. After performing a transaction, `money` becomes <code>money - cost<sub>i</sub> + cashback<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return the minimum amount of `money` required before any transaction so that all of the transactions can be completed **regardless of the order** of the transactions.
