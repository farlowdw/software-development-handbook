Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in **any order** the folders after removing.

If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `/` followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, `/leetcode` and `/leetcode/problems` are valid paths while an empty string and `/` are not.
