Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

- `Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.
- `next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.
- `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.
