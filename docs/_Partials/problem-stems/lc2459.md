You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` containing **each** element from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). Each of the elements from `1` to `n - 1` represents an item, and the element `0` represents an empty space.

In one operation, you can move **any** item to the empty space. `nums` is considered to be sorted if the numbers of all the items are in **ascending** order and the empty space is either at the beginning or at the end of the array.

For example, if `n = 4`, `nums` is sorted if:

- `nums = [0,1,2,3]` or
- `nums = [1,2,3,0]`

...and considered to be unsorted otherwise.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to sort `nums`.
