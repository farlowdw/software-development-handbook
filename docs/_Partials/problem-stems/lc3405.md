You are given three integers `n`, `m`, `k`. A **good array** `arr` of size `n` is defined as follows:

- Each element in `arr` is in the **inclusive** range `[1, m]`.
- Exactly `k` indices `i` (where `1 <= i < n`) satisfy the condition `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]`.

Return the number of **good arrays** that can be formed.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
