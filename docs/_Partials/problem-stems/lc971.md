You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given a sequence of `n` values `voyage`, which is the **desired** [pre-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order) of the binary tree.

Any node in the binary tree can be **flipped** by swapping its left and right subtrees. For example, flipping node `1` will have the following effect:

  <img width='400px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/971-f1.png').default} />
</p>

Flip the **smallest** number of nodes so that the **pre-order traversal** of the tree **matches** `voyage`.

Return a list of the values of all **flipped** nodes. You may return the answer in **any order**. If it is **impossible** to flip the nodes in the tree to make the pre-order traversal match `voyage`, return the list `[-1]`.
