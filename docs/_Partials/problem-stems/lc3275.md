There is an infinite 2D plane.

You are given a positive integer `k`. You are also given a 2D array `queries`, which contains the following queries:

- `queries[i] = [x, y]`: Build an obstacle at coordinate `(x, y)` in the plane. It is guaranteed that there is **no** obstacle at this coordinate when this query is made.

After each query, you need to find the **distance** of the `k`th **nearest** obstacle from the origin.

Return an integer array `results` where `results[i]` denotes the `k`th nearest obstacle after query `i`, or `results[i] == -1` if there are less than `k` obstacles.

**Note** that initially there are **no** obstacles anywhere.

The **distance** of an obstacle at coordinate `(x, y)` from the origin is given by `|x| + |y|`.
