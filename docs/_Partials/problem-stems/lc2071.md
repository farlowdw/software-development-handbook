You have `n` tasks and `m` workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, with the `i`th task requiring `tasks[i]` strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a **0-indexed** integer array `workers`, with the `j`th worker having `workers[j]` strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a **single** task and must have a strength **greater than or equal** to the task's strength requirement (i.e., `workers[j] >= tasks[i]`).

Additionally, you have `pills` magical pills that will **increase a worker's strength** by `strength`. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker **at most one** magical pill.

Given the **0-indexed** integer arrays `tasks` and `workers` and the integers `pills` and `strength`, return the **maximum** number of tasks that can be completed.
