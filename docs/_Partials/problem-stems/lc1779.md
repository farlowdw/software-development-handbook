You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each <code>points[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that a point exists at <code>(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>)</code>. A point is **valid** if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return the index **(0-indexed)** of the **valid** point with the smallest **Manhattan distance** from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the **smallest** index. If there are no valid points, return `-1`.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points <code>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</code> and <code>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</code> is <code>abs(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>) + abs(y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)</code>.
