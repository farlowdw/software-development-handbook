You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return all possible states of the string `currentState` after **one valid move**. You may return the answer in **any order**. If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.
