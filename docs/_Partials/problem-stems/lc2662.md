You are given an array `start` where `start = [startX, startY]` represents your initial position `(startX, startY)` in a 2D space. You are also given the array `target` where `target = [targetX, targetY]` represents your target position `(targetX, targetY)`.

The cost of going from a position `(x1, y1)` to any other position in the space `(x2, y2)` is `|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|`.

There are also some special roads. You are given a 2D array `specialRoads` where <code>specialRoads[i] = [x1<sub>i</sub>, y1<sub>i</sub>, x2<sub>i</sub>, y2<sub>i</sub>, cost<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the `i`th special road can take you from <code>(x1<sub>i</sub>, y1<sub>i</sub>)</code> to <code>(x2<sub>i</sub>, y2<sub>i</sub>)</code> with a cost equal to <code>cost<sub>i</sub></code>. You can use each special road any number of times.

Return the minimum cost required to go from `(startX, startY)` to `(targetX, targetY)`.
