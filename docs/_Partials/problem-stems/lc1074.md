Given a `matrix` and a `target`, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.

A submatrix `x1, y1, x2, y2` is the set of all cells `matrix[x][y]` with `x1 <= x <= x2` and `y1 <= y <= y2`.

Two submatrices `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1', y1', x2', y2')` are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if `x1 != x1'`.
