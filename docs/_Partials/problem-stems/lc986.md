You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where <code>firstList[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> and <code>secondList[j] = [start<sub>j</sub>, end<sub>j</sub>]</code>. Each list of intervals is pairwise **disjoint** and in **sorted order**.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a < b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.
