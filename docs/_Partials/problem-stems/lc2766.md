You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the initial positions of some marbles. You are also given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `moveFrom` and `moveTo` of **equal** length.

Throughout `moveFrom.length` steps, you will change the positions of the marbles. On the `i`th step, you will move **all** marbles at position `moveFrom[i]` to position `moveTo[i]`.

After completing all the steps, return the sorted list of **occupied** positions.

**Notes:**

- We call a position **occupied** if there is at least one marble in that position.
- There may be multiple marbles in a single position.
