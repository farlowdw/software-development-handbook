You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, and you are allowed to **traverse** between its indices. You can traverse between index `i` and index `j`, `i != j`, if and only if `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`, where `gcd` is the **greatest common divisor**.

Your task is to determine if for **every pair** of indices `i` and `j` in `nums`, where `i < j`, there exists a **sequence of traversals** that can take us from `i` to `j`.

Return `true` if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or `false` otherwise.
