**Table:** `Employees`

```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| employee_id  | int  |
| needed_hours | int  |
+--------------+------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains the id of an employee and the minimum number of hours needed for them to work to get their salary.

**Table:** `Logs`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| in_time     | datetime |
| out_time    | datetime |
+-------------+----------+
```

- `(employee_id, in_time, out_time)` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table shows the time stamps for an employee. `in_time` is the time the employee started to work, and `out_time` is the time the employee ended work.
- All the times are in October 2022. `out_time` can be one day after `in_time` which means the employee worked after the midnight.

In a company, each employee must work a certain number of hours every month. Employees work in sessions. The number of hours an employee worked can be calculated from the sum of the number of minutes the employee worked in all of their sessions. The number of minutes in each session is rounded up.

- For example, if the employee worked for `51` minutes and `2` seconds in a session, we consider it `52` minutes.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees that will be deducted. In other words, report the IDs of the employees that did not work the needed hours.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
