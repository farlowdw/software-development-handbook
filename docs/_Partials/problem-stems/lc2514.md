You are given a string `s` containing one or more words. Every consecutive pair of words is separated by a single space `' '`.

A string `t` is an **anagram** of string `s` if the `i`th word of `t` is a **permutation** of the `i`th word of `s`.

- For example, `"acb dfe"` is an anagram of `"abc def"`, but `"def cab"` and `"adc bef"` are not.

Return the number of **distinct anagrams** of `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
