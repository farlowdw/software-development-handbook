Given a list of **positive integers**, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, `[2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4`.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the **maximum** result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. **Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.**
