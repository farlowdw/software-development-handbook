You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this **modifies** the array for future operations.

Return the **minimum number** of operations to reduce `x` to **exactly** `0` if it's possible, otherwise, return `-1`.
