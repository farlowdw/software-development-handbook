You are given a string `word`, and an integer `numFriends`.

Alice is organizing a game for her `numFriends` friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

- `word` is split into `numFriends` **non-empty** strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
- All the split words are put into a box.

Find the **lexicographically largest** string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` characters do not differ, then the shorter string is the lexicographically smaller one.
