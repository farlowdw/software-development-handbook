**HTML entity parser** is the parser that takes HTML code as input and replace all the entities of the special characters by the characters itself.

The special characters and their entities for HTML are:

- **Quotation Mark**: the entity is `&quot;` and symbol character is `.
- **Single Quote Mark**: the entity is `&apos;` and symbol character is `'`.
- **Ampersand**: the entity is `&amp;` and symbol character is `&`.
- **Greater Than Sign**: the entity is `&gt;` and symbol character is `>`.
- **Less Than Sign**: the entity is `&lt;` and symbol character is `<`.
- **Slash**: the entity is `&frasl;` and symbol character is `/`.

Given the input `text` string to the HTML parser, you have to implement the entity parser.

Return the text after replacing the entities by the special characters.
