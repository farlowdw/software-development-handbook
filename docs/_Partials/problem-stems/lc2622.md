Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a **time until expiration** is associated with each key.

The class has three public methods:

`set(key, value, duration)`: accepts an integer `key`, an integer `value`, and a `duration` in milliseconds. Once the `duration` has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return `true` if the same un-expired key already exists and `false` otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.

`get(key)`: if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return `-1`.

`count()`: returns the count of un-expired keys.
