You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array queries of length `m`.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the **maximum** size of a **subsequence** that you can take from `nums` such that the **sum** of its elements is less than or equal to `queries[i]`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
