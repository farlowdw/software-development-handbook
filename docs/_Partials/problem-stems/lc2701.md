**Table:** `Transactions`

```
+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
```

- `transaction_id` is the primary key of this table. 
- Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique `(customer_id, transaction_date)` along with the corresponding `customer_id` and amount.  

Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing `amount` for at least three consecutive days. Include the `customer_id`, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.

Return the result table ordered by `customer_id` in **ascending** order.

The query result format is in the following example.
