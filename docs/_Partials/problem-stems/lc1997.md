There are `n` rooms you need to visit, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Each day is labeled, starting from `0`. You will go in and visit one room a day.

Initially on day `0`, you visit room `0`. The **order** you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following **rules** and a given **0-indexed** array `nextVisit` of length `n`:

- Assuming that on a day, you visit room `i`,
- if you have been in room `i` an **odd** number of times (**including** the current visit), on the **next** day you will visit a room with a **lower or equal room number** specified by `nextVisit[i]` where `0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i`;
- if you have been in room `i` an **even** number of times (**including** the current visit), on the **next** day you will visit room `(i + 1) mod n`.

Return the label of the **first** day where you have been in **all** the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
