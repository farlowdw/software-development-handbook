Consider a function that implements an algorithm **similar** to [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/). The function has two input parameters: `sequence` is a sequence of integers, and `target` is an integer value. The purpose of the function is to find if the `target` exists in the `sequence`.

The pseudocode of the function is as follows:

```
func(sequence, target)
  while sequence is not empty
    randomly choose an element from sequence as the pivot
    if pivot = target, return true
    else if pivot < target, remove pivot and all elements to its left from the sequence
    else, remove pivot and all elements to its right from the sequence
  end while
  return false
```

When the `sequence` is sorted, the function works correctly for **all** values. When the `sequence` is not sorted, the function does not work for all values, but may still work for **some** values.

Given an integer array `nums`, representing the `sequence`, that contains **unique** numbers and **may or may not be sorted**, return the number of values that are **guaranteed** to be found using the function, for **every possible** pivot selection.
