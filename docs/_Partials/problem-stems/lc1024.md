You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `T` seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip `clips[i]` is an interval: it starts at time `clips[i][0]` and ends at time `clips[i][1]`.  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event (`[0, T]`).  If the task is impossible, return `-1`.
