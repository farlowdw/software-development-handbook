There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a **unique** `rating` value.

You have to form a team of `3` soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

- Choose 3 soldiers with index (`i`, `j`, `k`) with rating (`rating[i]`, `rating[j]`, `rating[k]`).
- A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`0 <= i < j < k < n`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).
