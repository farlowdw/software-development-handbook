We start at some node in a directed graph, and every turn, we walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a terminal node (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

We define a starting node to be **safe** if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there is a natural number `k`, so that we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `k` steps for **any choice of where to walk**.

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in **ascending** order.

The directed graph has `n` nodes with labels from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `graph`. The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph, going from node `i` to node `j`.
