In a project, you have a list of required skills `req_skills`, and a list of people. The `i`th person `people[i]` contains a list of skills that the person has.

Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in `req_skills`, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.

- For example, `team = [0, 1, 3]` represents the people with skills `people[0]`, `people[1]`, and `people[3]`.

Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in **any order**.

It is **guaranteed** an answer exists.
