You are given an `m x n` grid `grid` of values `0`, `1`, or `2`, where:

- each `0` marks **an empty land** that you can pass by freely,
- each `1` marks **a building** that you cannot pass through, and
- each `2` marks **an obstacle** that you cannot pass through.

You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the **shortest total travel** distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.

Return the **shortest travel distance** for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return `-1`.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.
