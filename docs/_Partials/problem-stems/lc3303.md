You are given two strings `s` and `pattern`.

A string `x` is called **almost equal** to `y` if you can change **at most** one character in `x` to make it identical to `y`.

Return the **smallest** starting index of a substring in `s` that is **almost equal** to `pattern`. If no such index exists, return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.
