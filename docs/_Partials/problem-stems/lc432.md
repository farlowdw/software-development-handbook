Implement a data structure supporting the following operations:

Design a data structure to store the strings' count with the ability to return the strings with minimum and maximum counts.

Implement the `AllOne` class:

- `AllOne()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `inc(String key)` Increments the count of the string `key` by `1`. If `key` does not exist in the data structure, insert it with count `1`.
- `dec(String key)` Decrements the count of the string `key` by `1`. If the count of `key` is `0` after the decrement, remove it from the data structure. It is guaranteed that key exists in the data structure before the decrement.
- `getMaxKey()` Returns one of the keys with the maximal count. If no element exists, return an empty string `""`.
- `getMinKey()` Returns one of the keys with the minimum count. If no element exists, return an empty string `""`.

**Note** that each function must run in $O(1)$ average time complexity.
