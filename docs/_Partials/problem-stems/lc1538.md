We have an integer array `nums`, where all the integers in `nums` are `0` or `1`. You will not be given direct access to the array, instead, you will have an API `ArrayReader` which have the following functions:

- `int query(int a, int b, int c, int d)`: where `0 <= a < b < c < d < ArrayReader.length()`. The function returns the distribution of the value of the 4 elements and returns:
  + `4`: if the values of the 4 elements are the same (`0` or `1`).
  + `2`: if three elements have a value equal to `0` and one element has value equal to `1` or vice versa.
  + `0`: if two elements have a value equal to `0` and two elements have a value equal to `1`.
- `int length()`: Returns the size of the array.

You are allowed to call `query()` **`2 * n`** times at most where `n` is equal to `ArrayReader.length()`.

Return **any** index of the most frequent value in `nums`, in case of tie, return `-1`.
