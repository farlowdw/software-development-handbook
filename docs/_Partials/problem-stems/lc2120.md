There is an `n x n` grid, with the top-left cell at `(0, 0)` and the bottom-right cell at `(n - 1, n - 1)`. You are given the integer `n` and an integer array `startPos` where <code>startPos = [start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>]</code> indicates that a robot is initially at cell <code>(start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>)</code>.

You are also given a **0-indexed** string `s` of length `m` where `s[i]` is the `i`th instruction for the robot: `'L'` (move left), `'R'` (move right), `'U'` (move up), and `'D'` (move down).

The robot can begin executing from any `i`th instruction in `s`. It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of `s` but it stops if either of these conditions is met:

- The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
- There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is **the number of instructions** the robot can execute if the robot **begins executing from** the `i`th instruction in `s`.
