Design a number container system that can do the following:

- **Insert** or **Replace** a number at the given index in the system.
- **Return** the smallest index for the given number in the system.

Implement the `NumberContainers` class:

- `NumberContainers()` Initializes the number container system.
- `void change(int index, int number)` Fills the container at `index` with the `number`. If there is already a number at that `index`, replace it.
- `int find(int number)` Returns the smallest index for the given `number`, or `-1` if there is no index that is filled by `number` in the system.
