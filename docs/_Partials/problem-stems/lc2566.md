You are given an integer `num`. You know that Danny Mittal will sneakily **remap** one of the `10` possible digits (`0` to `9`) to another digit.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values Danny can make by remapping **exactly one** digit in `num`.

**Notes:**

- When Danny remaps a digit `d1` to another digit `d2`, Danny replaces all occurrences of `d1` in num with `d2`.
- Danny can remap a digit to itself, in which case `num` does not change.
- Danny can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
- The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.
- We mentioned "Danny Mittal" to congratulate him on being in the top 10 in Weekly Contest 326.
