You are given a 2D integer array `grid` with size `m x n`. You are also given an integer `k`.

Your task is to calculate the number of paths you can take from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` satisfying the following constraints:

- You can either move to the right or down. Formally, from the cell `(i, j)` you may move to the cell `(i, j + 1)` or to the cell `(i + 1, j)` if the target cell *exists*.
- The `XOR` of all the numbers on the path must be equal to `k`.

Return the total number of such paths.

Since the answer can be very large, return the result modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
