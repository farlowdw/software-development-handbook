You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `items` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

<code>items[i] = [profit<sub>i</sub>, category<sub>i</sub>]</code>, where <code>profit<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>category<sub>i</sub></code> denote the profit and category of the `i`th item respectively.

Let's define the **elegance** of a **subsequence** of `items` as <code>total_profit + distinct_categories<sup>2</sup></code>, where `total_profit` is the sum of all profits in the subsequence, and `distinct_categories` is the number of **distinct** categories from all the categories in the selected subsequence.

Your task is to find the **maximum elegance** from all subsequences of size `k` in `items`.

Return an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of `items` with size exactly `k`.

**Note:** A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order.
