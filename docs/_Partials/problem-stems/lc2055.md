There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a plate and a `'|'` represents a candle.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the **substring** <code>s[left<sub>i</sub>...right<sub>i</sub>]</code> (**inclusive**). For each query, you need to find the **number** of plates **between candles** that are **in the substring**. A plate is considered **between candles** if there is at least one candle to its left **and** at least one candle to its right **in the substring**.

- For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring <code>"*||<u>**</u>|"</code>. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle <strong>in the substring</strong> to its left <strong>and</strong> right.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.
