**Table:** `Votes`

- `(voter, candidate)` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table contains name of the voter and their candidate. 

The election is conducted in a city where everyone can vote for **one or more** candidates or choose **not** to vote. Each person has `1` **vote** so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across them. For example, if a person votes for `2` candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of `0.5` votes each.

Write an SQL query to find `candidate` who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the **candidate** or if multiple candidates have an **equal number** of votes, display the names of all of them.

Return the result table ordered by `candidate` in **ascending** order.

The query result format is in the following example.
