There are `N` cities numbered from `1` to `N`.

You are given `connections`, where each `connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost]` represents the cost to connect `city1` and `city2` together.  (A connection is bidirectional: connecting `city1` and `city2` is the same as connecting `city2` and `city1`.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length `1`) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.
