You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` containing **distinct** numbers, an integer `start`, and an integer `goal`. There is an integer `x` that is initially set to `start`, and you want to perform operations on `x` such that it is converted to `goal`. You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number `x`:

If `0 <= x <= 1000`, then for any index `i` in the array (`0 <= i < nums.length`), you can set `x` to any of the following:

- `x + nums[i]`
- `x - nums[i]`
- `x ^ nums[i]` (bitwise-XOR)

Note that you can use each `nums[i]` any number of times in any order. Operations that set `x` to be out of the range `0 <= x <= 1000` are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to convert `x = start` into `goal`, and `-1` if it is not possible.
