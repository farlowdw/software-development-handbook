You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `player1` and `player2`, that represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.

The bowling game consists of `n` turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly `10`.

Assume a player hit <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> pins in the `i`th turn. The value of the `i`th turn for the player is:

- <code>2x<sub>i</sub></code> if the player hit `10` pins in any of the previous two turns.
- Otherwise, it is <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>.

The score of the player is the sum of the values of their `n` turns.

Return

- `1` if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
- `2` if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
- `0` in case of a draw.
