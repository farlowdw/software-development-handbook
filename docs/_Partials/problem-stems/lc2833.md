You are given a string `moves` of length `n` consisting only of characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`. The string represents your movement on a number line starting from the origin `0`.

In the `i`th move, you can choose one of the following directions:

- move to the left if `moves[i] = 'L'` or `moves[i] = '_'`
- move to the right if `moves[i] = 'R'` or `moves[i] = '_'`

Return the **distance from the origin** of the **furthest** point you can get to after `n` moves.
