In the following, every capital letter represents some hexadecimal digit from `0` to `f`.

The red-green-blue color `"#AABBCC"` can be written as `"#ABC"` in shorthand. For example, `"#15c"` is shorthand for the color `"#1155cc"`.

Now, say the similarity between two colors `"#ABCDEF"` and `"#UVWXYZ"` is `-(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2`.

Given the color `"#ABCDEF"`, return a `7` character color that is most similar to `#ABCDEF`, and has a shorthand (that is, it can be represented as some `"#XYZ"`).
