You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `mat` and an integer `cols`, which denotes the number of columns you must choose.

A row is **covered** by a set of columns if each cell in the row that has a value of `1` also lies in one of the columns of the chosen set.

Return the **maximum** number of rows that can be **covered** by a set of `cols` columns.
