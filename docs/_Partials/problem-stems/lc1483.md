You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. The root of the tree is node `0`.

Implement the function `getKthAncestor(int node, int k)` to return the `k`th ancestor of the given `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

The `k`th ancestor of a tree node is the `k`th node in the path from that node to the root.
