An experiment is being conducted in a lab. To ensure accuracy, there are **two** sensors collecting data simultaneously. You are given `2` arrays `sensor1` and `sensor2`, where `sensor1[i]` and `sensor2[i]` are the `i`th data points collected by the two sensors.

However, this type of sensor has a chance of being defective, which causes **exactly one** data point to be dropped. After the data is dropped, all the data points to the **right** of the dropped data are **shifted** one place to the left, and the last data point is replaced with some **random value**. It is guaranteed that this random value will **not** be equal to the dropped value.

- For example, if the correct data is <code>[1,2,<u><strong>3</strong></u>,4,5]</code> and 3 is dropped, the sensor could return [1,2,4,5,<u><strong>7</strong></u>] (the last position can be **any** value, not just `7`).

We know that there is a defect in **at most one** of the sensors. Return the sensor number (`1` or `2`) with the defect. If there is **no defect** in either sensor or if it is **impossible** to determine the defective sensor, return `-1`.
