You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `nums`. Initially, your score is `0`. Perform the following operations until the matrix becomes empty:

1. From each row in the matrix, select the largest number and remove it. In the case of a tie, it does not matter which number is chosen.
2. Identify the highest number amongst all those removed in step 1. Add that number to your **score**.

Return the final **score**.
