You are given a **0-indexed** string `word`.

In one operation, you can pick any index `i` of `word` and change `word[i]` to any lowercase English letter.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to remove all adjacent **almost-equal** characters from `word`.

Two characters `a` and `b` are **almost-equal** if `a == b` or `a` and `b` are adjacent in the alphabet.
