Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return a string representing the **category** of the box.

- The box is `"Bulky"` if:
  + **Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to <code>10<sup>4</sup></code>.
  + Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to <code>10<sup>9</sup></code>.
- If the mass of the box is greater or equal to `100`, it is `"Heavy"`.
- If the box is both `"Bulky"` and `"Heavy"`, then its category is `"Both"`.
- If the box is neither `"Bulky"` nor `"Heavy"`, then its category is `"Neither"`.
- If the box is `"Bulky"` but not `"Heavy"`, then its category is `"Bulky"`.
- If the box is `"Heavy"` but not `"Bulky"`, then its category is `"Heavy"`.

**Note** that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and height.
