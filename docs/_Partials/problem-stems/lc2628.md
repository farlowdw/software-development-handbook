Given two objects `o1` and `o2`, check if they are **deeply equal**.

For two objects to be **deeply equal**, they must contain the same keys, and the associated values must also be **deeply equal**. Two objects are also considered **deeply equal** if they pass the `===` equality check.

You may assume both objects are the output of `JSON.parse`. In other words, they are valid JSON.

Please solve it without using lodash's `_.isEqual()` function.
