Implement a last in first out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
- `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

- You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
