You are given a string `s`.

A string `t` is called **good** if all characters of `t` occur the same number of times.

You can perform the following operations **any number of times**:

- Delete a character from `s`.
- Insert a character in `s`.
- Change a character in `s` to its next letter in the alphabet.

**Note** that you cannot change `'z'` to `'a'` using the third operation.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `s` **good**.
