You are given a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:

- Delete **the entire string** `s`, or
- Delete the **first** `i` letters of `s` if the first `i` letters of `s` are **equal** to the following `i` letters in `s`, for any `i` in the range `1 <= i <= s.length / 2`.

For example, if `s = "ababc"`, then in one operation, you could delete the first two letters of `s` to get `"abc"`, since the first two letters of `s` and the following two letters of `s` are both equal to `"ab"`.

Return the **maximum** number of operations needed to delete all of `s`.
