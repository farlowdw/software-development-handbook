Given an integer array `arr` and a target value `target`, return the integer `value` such that when we change all the integers larger than `value` in the given array to be equal to value, the sum of the array gets as close as possible (in absolute difference) to `target`.

In case of a tie, return the minimum such integer.

Notice that the answer is not neccesarilly a number from `arr`.
