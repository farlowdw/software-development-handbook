A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:

- It has at least `6` characters and at most `20` characters.
- It contains at least **one lowercase** letter, at least **one uppercase** letter, and at least **one digit**.
- It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., `"...aaa..."` is weak, but `"...aa...a..."` is strong, assuming other conditions are met).

Given a string `password`, return the minimum number of steps required to make `password` strong. if `password` is already strong, return `0`.

In one step, you can:

- Insert one character to `password`,
- Delete one character from `password`, or
- Replace one character of `password` with another character.
