You have `n` gardens, labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array paths where <code>paths[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes a bidirectional path between garden <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> to garden <code>y<sub>i</sub></code>. In each garden, you want to plant one of `4` types of flowers.

All gardens have **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return **any** such a choice as an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the <code>(i+1)<sub>th</sub></code> garden. The flower types are denoted `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`. It is guaranteed an answer exists.
