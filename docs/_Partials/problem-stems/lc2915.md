You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums`, and an integer `target`.

Return the **length of the longest subsequence** of `nums` that sums up to `target`. If no such subsequence exists, return `-1`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
