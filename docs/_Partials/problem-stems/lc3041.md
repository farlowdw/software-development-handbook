You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Initially, you can increase the value of **any** element in the array by **at most** `1`.

After that, you need to select **one or more** elements from the final array such that those elements are **consecutive** when sorted in increasing order. For example, the elements `[3, 4, 5]` are consecutive while `[3, 4, 6]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]` are not.

Return the **maximum** number of elements that you can select.
