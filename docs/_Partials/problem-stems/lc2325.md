You are given the strings `key` and `message`, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode `message` are as follows:

1. Use the **first** appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in `key` as the **order** of the substitution table.
2. Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
3. Each letter in `message` is then **substituted** using the table.
4. Spaces `' '` are transformed to themselves.

- For example, given <code>key = "<b><u>hap</u></b>p<b><u>y</u></b> <b><u>bo</u></b>y"</code> (actual key would have **at least one** instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of (`'h' -> 'a'`, `'a' -> 'b'`, `'p' -> 'c'`, `'y' -> 'd'`, `'b' -> 'e'`, `'o' -> 'f'`).

Return the decoded message.
