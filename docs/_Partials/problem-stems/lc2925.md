There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` of length `n`, where `values[i]` is the **value** associated with the `i`th node.

You start with a score of `0`. In one operation, you can:

- Pick any node `i`.
- Add `values[i]` to your score.
- Set `values[i]` to `0`.

A tree is **healthy** if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.

Return the **maximum score** you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains **healthy**.
