You are given an array `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> is the coordinates of the `i`th point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the **same** coordinates.

You are also given an array `queries` where <code>queries[j] = [x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>, r<sub>j</sub>]</code> describes a circle centered at <code>(x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>)</code> with a radius of <code>r<sub>j</sub></code>.

For each query `queries[j]`, compute the number of points **inside** the `j`th circle. Points **on the border** of the circle are considered **inside**.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j`th query.
