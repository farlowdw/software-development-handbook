You are given positive integers `n` and `m`.

Define two integers, `num1` and `num2`, as follows:

- `num1`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are **not divisible** by `m`.
- `num2`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are **divisible** by `m`.

Return the integer `num1 - num2`.
