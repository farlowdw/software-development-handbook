(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)

You may recall that an array `A` is a mountain array if and only if:

- `A.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that:
  + `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]`
  + `A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the **minimum** `index` such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`.  If such an `index` doesn't exist, return `-1`.

**You can't access the mountain array directly.**  You may only access the array using a `MountainArray` interface:

- `MountainArray.get(k)` returns the element of the array at index `k` (0-indexed).
- `MountainArray.length()` returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than `100` calls to `MountainArray.get` will be judged *Wrong Answer*.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
