You are given two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity` liters. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.

If `targetCapacity` liters of water are measurable, you must have `targetCapacity` liters of water contained **within one or both buckets** by the end.

Operations allowed:

- Fill any of the jugs with water.
- Empty any of the jugs.
- Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.
