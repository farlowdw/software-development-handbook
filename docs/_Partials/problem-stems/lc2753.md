You are given an object `street` of class `Street` that represents a **circular** street and a positive integer `k` which represents a maximum bound for the number of houses in that street (in other words, the number of houses is less than or equal to `k`). Houses' doors could be open or closed initially (at least one is open).

Initially, you are standing in front of a door to a house on this street. Your task is to count the number of houses in the street.

The class `Street` contains the following functions which may help you:

- `void closeDoor()`: Close the door of the house you are in front of.
- `boolean isDoorOpen()`: Returns `true` if the door of the current house is open and `false` otherwise.
- `void moveRight()`: Move to the right house.

**Note** that by **circular** street, we mean if you number the houses from `1` to `n`, then the right house of <code>house<sub>i</sub></code> is <code>house<sub>i+1</sub></code> for `i < n`, and the right house of <code>house<sub>n</sub></code> is <code>house<sub>1</sub></code>.

Return `ans` which represents the number of houses on this street.
