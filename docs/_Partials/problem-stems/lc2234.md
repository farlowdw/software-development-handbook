Alice is a caretaker of `n` gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `flowers` of size `n`, where `flowers[i]` is the number of flowers already planted in the `i`th garden. Flowers that are already planted **cannot** be removed. You are then given another integer `newFlowers`, which is the **maximum** number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers `target`, `full`, and `partial`.

A garden is considered **complete** if it has **at least** `target` flowers. The **total beauty** of the gardens is then determined as the **sum** of the following:

- The number of **complete** gardens multiplied by `full`.
- The **minimum** number of flowers in any of the **incomplete** gardens multiplied by `partial`. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be `0`.

Return the **maximum** total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most `newFlowers` flowers.
