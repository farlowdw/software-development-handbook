You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

You are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string `t`.

The score of the string is `0` if no characters are removed from the string `t`, otherwise:

- Let `left` be the minimum index among all removed characters.
- Let `right` be the maximum index among all removed characters.

Then the score of the string is `right - left + 1`.

Return the minimum possible score to make `t` a subsequence of `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).
