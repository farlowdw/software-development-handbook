Write your version of method `forEach` that enhances all arrays such that you can call the `array.forEach(callback, context)` method on any array and it will execute `callback` on each element of the array. Method `forEach` should not return anything.

`callback` accepts the following arguments:

- `value` &#8212; represents the current element being processed in the array. It is the value of the element in the current iteration.
- `index` &#8212; represents the index of the current element being processed in the array.
- `array` &#8212; represents the array itself, allowing access to the entire array within the callback function.

The `context` is the object that should be passed as the function context parameter to the `callback` function, ensuring that the `this` keyword within the callback function refers to this `context` object.

Try to implement it without using the built-in array methods.
