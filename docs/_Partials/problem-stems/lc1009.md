Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation.  For example, `5` can be represented as `"101"` in binary, `11` as `"1011"` in binary, and so on.  Note that except for `N = 0`, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every `1` to a `0` and `0` to a `1`.  For example, the complement of `"101"` in binary is `"010"` in binary.

For a given number `N` in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.
