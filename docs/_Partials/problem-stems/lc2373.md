You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`.

Generate an integer matrix `maxLocal` of size `(n - 2) x (n - 2)` such that:

- `maxLocal[i][j]` is equal to the **largest** value of the `3 x 3` matrix in `grid` centered around row `i + 1` and column `j + 1`.

In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous `3 x 3` matrix in `grid`.

Return the generated matrix.
