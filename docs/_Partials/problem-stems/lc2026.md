- `problem_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the number of likes and dislikes for a LeetCode problem.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the **low-quality** problems. A LeetCode problem is **low-quality** if the like percentage of the problem (number of likes divided by the total number of votes) is **strictly less than** `60%`.

Return the result table ordered by `problem_id` in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.
