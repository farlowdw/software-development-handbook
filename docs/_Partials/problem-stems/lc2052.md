You are given a string `sentence` containing words separated by spaces, and an integer `k`. Your task is to separate `sentence` into **rows** where the number of characters in each row is **at most** `k`. You may assume that `sentence` does not begin or end with a space, and the words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.

You can split `sentence` into rows by inserting line breaks between words in `sentence`. A word **cannot** be split between two rows. Each word must be used exactly once, and the word order cannot be rearranged. Adjacent words in a row should be separated by a single space, and rows should not begin or end with spaces.

The **cost** of a row with length `n` is <code>(k - n)<sup>2</sup></code>, and the **total cost** is the sum of the **costs** for all rows **except** the last one.

- For example if `sentence = "i love leetcode"` and `k = 12`:
  + Separating `sentence` into `"i"`, `"love"`, and `"leetcode"` has a cost of <code>(12 - 1)<sup>2</sup> + (12 - 4)<sup>2</sup> = 185</code>.
  + Separating `sentence` into `"i love"`, and `"leetcode"` has a cost of <code>(12 - 6)<sup>2</sup> = 36</code>.
  + Separating `sentence` into `"i"`, and `"love leetcode"` is not possible because the length of `"love leetcode"` is greater than `k`.

Return the **minimum** possible total cost of separating `sentence` into rows.
