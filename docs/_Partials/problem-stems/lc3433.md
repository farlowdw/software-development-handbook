You are given an integer `numberOfUsers` representing the total number of users and an array `events` of size `n x 3`.

Each `events[i]` can be either of the following two types:

1. **Message Event:** <code>["MESSAGE", "timestamp<sub>i</sub>", "mentions_string<sub>i</sub>"]</code>

    - This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at <code>timestamp<sub>i</sub></code>.
    - The <code>mentions_string<sub>i</sub></code> string can contain one of the following tokens:
        + `id<number>`: where `<number>` is an integer in range `[0,numberOfUsers - 1]`. There can be **multiple** ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
        + `ALL`: mentions **all** users.
        + `HERE`: mentions all **online** users.

2. **Offline Event:** <code>["OFFLINE", "timestamp<sub>i</sub>", "id<sub>i</sub>"]</code>

    - This event indicates that the user <code>id<sub>i</sub></code> had become offline at <code>timestamp<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>60</code> time units. The user will automatically be online again at time <code>timestamp<sub>i</sub> + 60</code>.

Return an array `mentions` where `mentions[i]` represents the number of mentions the user with id `i` has across all `MESSAGE` events.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed *before* handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

Note that a user can be mentioned **multiple** times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted **separately**.
