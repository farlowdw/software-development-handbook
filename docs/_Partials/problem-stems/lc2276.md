Given an **empty** set of intervals, implement a data structure that can:

- **Add** an interval to the set of intervals.
- **Count** the number of integers that are present in **at least one** interval.

Implement the `CountIntervals` class:

- `CountIntervals()` Initializes the object with an empty set of intervals.
- `void add(int left, int right)` Adds the interval `[left, right]` to the set of intervals.
- `int count()` Returns the number of integers that are present in **at least one** interval.

**Note** that an interval `[left, right]` denotes all the integers `x` where `left <= x <= right`.
