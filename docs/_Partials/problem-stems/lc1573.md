Given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of `'0'`s and `'1'`s), we can split `s` into 3 **non-empty** strings `s1`, `s2`, `s3` (`s1+ s2+ s3 = s`).

Return the number of ways `s` can be split such that the number of characters `'1'` is the same in `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
