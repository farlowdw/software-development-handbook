You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.

In one **move**, you can select any two **adjacent** characters of `s` and swap them.

Return the **minimum number of moves** needed to make `s` a palindrome.

**Note** that the input will be generated such that `s` can always be converted to a palindrome.
