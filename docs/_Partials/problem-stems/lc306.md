Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits `'0'-'9'`, write a function to determine if it's an additive number.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.
