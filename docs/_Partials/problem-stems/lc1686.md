Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can **remove** a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may **value the stones differently**.

You are given two integer arrays of length `n`, `aliceValues` and `bobValues`. Each `aliceValues[i]` and `bobValues[i]` represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the `i`th stone.

The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play **optimally**. Both players know the other's values.

Determine the result of the game, and:

- If Alice wins, return `1`.
- If Bob wins, return `-1`.
- If the game results in a draw, return `0`.
