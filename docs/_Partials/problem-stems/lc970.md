Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, return a list of all the **powerful integers** that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

An integer is **powerful** if it can be represented as <code>x<sup>i</sup> + y<sup>j</sup></code> for some integers `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

You may return the answer in **any order**. In your answer, each value should occur **at most once**.
