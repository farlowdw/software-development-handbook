You have `n` packages that you are trying to place in boxes, **one package in each box**. There are `m` suppliers that each produce boxes of **different sizes** (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is **less than or equal to** the size of the box.

The package sizes are given as an integer array `packages`, where `packages[i]` is the **size** of the `i`th package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array `boxes`, where `boxes[j]` is an array of **box sizes** that the `j`th supplier produces.

You want to choose a **single supplier** and use boxes from them such that the **total wasted space** is **minimized**. For each package in a box, we define the space **wasted** to be `size of the box - size of the package`. The **total wasted space** is the sum of the space wasted in **all** the boxes.

- For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes `[2,3,5]` and the supplier offers boxes of sizes `[4,8]`, you can fit the packages of size-`2` and size-`3` into two boxes of size-`4` and the package with size-`5` into a box of size-`8`. This would result in a waste of `(4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6`.

Return the **minimum total wasted space** by choosing the box supplier **optimally**, or `-1` if it is **impossible** to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be **large**, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
