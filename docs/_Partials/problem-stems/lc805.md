You are given an integer array `nums`.

You should move each element of `nums` into one of the two arrays `A` and `B` such that `A` and `B` are non-empty, and `average(A) == average(B)`.

Return `true` if it is possible to achieve that and `false` otherwise.

**Note** that for an array `arr`, `average(arr)` is the sum of all the elements of `arr` over the length of `arr`.
