You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n x m`, where each element is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

A V-shaped diagonal segment is defined as:

- The segment starts with `1`.
- The subsequent elements follow this infinite sequence: `2`, `0`, `2`, `0`, `...`.
- The segment:
  + Starts along a diagonal direction (top-left to bottom-right, bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, or bottom-left to top-right).
  + Continues the sequence in the same diagonal direction.
  + Makes at most one clockwise 90-degree turn to another diagonal direction while maintaining the sequence.

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/3459-f1.png').default} />
</div>

Return the length of the longest V-shaped diagonal segment. If no valid segment exists, return `0`.
