Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even `i`, `A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements (`n >= 1`) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

For example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`.  This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".
