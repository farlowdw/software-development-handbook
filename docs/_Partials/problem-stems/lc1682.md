A subsequence of a string `s` is considered a **good palindromic subsequence** if:

- It is a subsequence of `s`.
- It is a palindrome (has the same value if reversed).
- It has an **even** length.
- No two consecutive characters are equal, except the two middle ones.

For example, if `s = "abcabcabb"`, then `"abba"` is considered a **good palindromic subsequence**, while `"bcb"` (not even length) and `"bbbb"` (has equal consecutive characters) are not.

Given a string `s`, return the **length** of the **longest good palindromic subsequence** in `s`.
