A **k-mirror number** is a **positive** integer **without leading zeros** that reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 **as well as** in base-k.

- For example, `9` is a 2-mirror number. The representation of `9` in base-10 and base-2 are `9` and `1001` respectively, which read the same both forward and backward.
- On the contrary, `4` is not a 2-mirror number. The representation of `4` in base-2 is `100`, which does not read the same both forward and backward.

Given the base `k` and the number `n`, return the **sum** of the `n` **smallest** k-mirror numbers.
