You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return the length of the **longest semi-decreasing** subarray of `nums`, and `0` if there are no such subarrays.

- A `subarray` is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
- A non-empty array is **semi-decreasing** if its first element is **strictly greater** than its last element.
