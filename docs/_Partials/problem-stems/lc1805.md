You are given a string `word` that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, `"a123bc34d8ef34"` will become `" 123  34 8  34"`. Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: `"123"`, `"34"`, `"8"`, and `"34"`.

Return the number of **different** integers after performing the replacement operations on `word`.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations **without any leading zeros** are different.
