If the depth of a tree is smaller than `5`, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:

1. The hundreds digit represents the depth `D` of this node, `1 <= D <= 4`.
2. The tens digit represents the position `P` of this node in the level it belongs to, `1 <= P <= 8`. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
3. The units digit represents the value `V` of this node, `0 <= V <= 9`.

Given a list of `ascending` three-digits integers representing a binary tree with the depth smaller than 5, you need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

It's guaranteed that the given list represents a valid connected binary tree.
