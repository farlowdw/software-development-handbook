You are given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of **non-negative** integers where `grid[row][col]` represents the **minimum** time required to be able to visit the cell `(row, col)`, which means you can visit the cell `(row, col)` only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to `grid[row][col]`.

You are standing in the **top-left** cell of the matrix in the `0`th second, and you must move to **any** adjacent cell in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move you make takes 1 second.

Return the **minimum** time required in which you can visit the bottom-right cell of the matrix. If you cannot visit the bottom-right cell, then return `-1`.
