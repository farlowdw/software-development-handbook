Given an array `nums` and an integer `m`, with each element `nums[i]` satisfying <code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt; 2<sup>m</sup></code>, return an array `answer`. The `answer` array should be of the same length as `nums`, where each element `answer[i]` represents the maximum **Hamming distance** between `nums[i]` and any other element `nums[j]` in the array.

The **Hamming distance** between two binary integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits differ (add leading zeroes if needed).
