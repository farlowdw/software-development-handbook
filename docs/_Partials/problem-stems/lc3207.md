You are given an integer array `enemyEnergies` denoting the energy values of various enemies.

You are also given an integer `currentEnergy` denoting the amount of energy you have initially.

You start with `0` points, and all the enemies are unmarked initially.

You can perform **either** of the following operations **zero** or multiple times to gain points:

- Choose an **unmarked** enemy, `i`, such that `currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]`. By choosing this option:
  + You gain `1` point.
  + Your energy is reduced by the enemy's energy, i.e. `currentEnergy = currentEnergy - enemyEnergies[i]`.
- If you have **at least** `1` point, you can choose an **unmarked** enemy, `i`. By choosing this option:
  + Your energy increases by the enemy's energy, i.e. `currentEnergy = currentEnergy + enemyEnergies[i]`.
  + The enemy `i` is **marked**.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** points you can get in the end by optimally performing operations.
