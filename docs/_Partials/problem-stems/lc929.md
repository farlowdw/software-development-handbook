Every **valid email** consists of a **local name** and a **domain name**, separated by the `'@'` sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more `'.'` or `'+'`.

- For example, in `"alice@leetcode.com"`, `"alice"` is the **local name**, and `"leetcode.com"` is the **domain name**.

If you add periods `'.'` between some characters in the **local name** part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule **does not apply** to **domain names**.

- For example, `"alice.z@leetcode.com"` and `"alicez@leetcode.com"` forward to the same email address.

If you add a plus `'+'` in the **local name**, everything after the first plus sign **will be ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule **does not apply** to **domain names**.

- For example, `"m.y+name@email.com"` will be forwarded to `"my@email.com"`.

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given an array of strings `emails` where we send one email to each `email[i]`, return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.
