You are given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `fx`, `fy`, and a non-negative integer `t`.

In an infinite 2D grid, you start at the cell `(sx, sy)`. Each second, you **must** move to any of its adjacent cells.

Return `true` if you can reach cell `(fx, fy)` after **exactly** `t` **seconds**, or `false` otherwise.

A cell's **adjacent cells** are the 8 cells around it that share at least one corner with it. You can visit the same cell several times.
