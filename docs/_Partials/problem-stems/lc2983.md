You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` having an **even** length `n`.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array, `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>, d<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

For each query `i`, you are allowed to perform the following operations:

- Rearrange the characters within the **substring** <code>s[a<sub>i</sub>:b<sub>i</sub>]</code>, where <code>0 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub> &lt;= b<sub>i</sub> &lt; n / 2</code>.
- Rearrange the characters within the **substring** <code>s[c<sub>i</sub>:d<sub>i</sub>]</code>, where <code>n / 2 &lt;= c<sub>i</sub> &lt;= d<sub>i</sub> &lt; n</code>.

For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make `s` a **palindrome** by performing the operations.

Each query is answered **independently** of the others.

Return a **0-indexed** array `answer`, where `answer[i] == true` if it is possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing operations specified by the `i`th query, and `false` otherwise.

- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- `s[x:y]` represents the substring consisting of characters from the index `x` to index `y` in `s`, **both inclusive**.
