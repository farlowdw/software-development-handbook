Given the array `restaurants` where <code>restaurants[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, rating<sub>i</sub>, veganFriendly<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]</code>. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The `veganFriendly` filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with <code>veganFriendly<sub>i</sub></code> set to `true`) or `false` (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant **IDs** after filtering, ordered by **rating** from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by **id** from highest to lowest. For simplicity <code>veganFriendly<sub>i</sub></code> and `veganFriendly` take value `1` when it is `true`, and `0` when it is `false`.
