You are given a 2D integer array `items` where <code>items[i] = [price<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the price and weight of the `i`th item, respectively.

You are also given a **positive** integer `capacity`.

Each item can be divided into two items with ratios `part1` and `part2`, where `part1 + part2 == 1`.
- The weight of the first item is <code>weight<sub>i</sub> &#42; part1</code> and the price of the first item is <code>price<sub>i</sub> &#42; part1</code>.
- Similarly, the weight of the second item is <code>weight<sub>i</sub> &#42; part2</code> and the price of the second item is <code>price<sub>i</sub> &#42; part2</code>.

Return **the maximum total price** to fill a bag of capacity `capacity` with given items. If it is impossible to fill a bag return `-1`. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the **actual answer** will be considered accepted.
