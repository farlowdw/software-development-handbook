You are given an array `A` of strings.

A move onto `S` consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of `S`, or any two odd indexed characters of `S`.

Two strings `S` and `T` are special-equivalent if after any number of moves onto `S`, `S == T`.

For example, `S = "zzxy"` and `T = "xyzz"` are special-equivalent because we may make the moves `"zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz"` that swap `S[0]` and `S[2]`, then `S[1]` and `S[3]`.

Now, a group of special-equivalent strings from `A` is a non-empty subset of `A` such that:

1. Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
2. The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string `S` not in the group such that `S` is special equivalent to every string in the group)

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.
