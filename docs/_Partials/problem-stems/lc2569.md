You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and a 2D array `queries` of queries. There are three types of queries:

1. For a query of type 1, `queries[i] = [1, l, r]`. Flip the values from `0` to `1` and from `1` to `0` in `nums1` from index `l` to index `r`. Both `l` and `r` are **0-indexed**.
2. For a query of type 2, `queries[i] = [2, p, 0]`. For every index `0 <= i < n`, set `nums2[i] = nums2[i] + nums1[i] * p`.
3. For a query of type 3, `queries[i] = [3, 0, 0]`. Find the sum of the elements in `nums2`.

Return an array containing all the answers to the third type queries.
