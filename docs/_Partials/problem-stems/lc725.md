Given a (singly) linked list with head node `root`, write a function to split the linked list into `k` consecutive linked list "parts".

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than `1`. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.

Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are formed.

Examples `1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5` equal parts `[ [1], [2], [3], [4], null ]`
