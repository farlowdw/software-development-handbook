You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

- **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string `s` and **append** it to the end of the string.
- **Type-2: Pick** any character in `s` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.

Return the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform such that `s` becomes **alternating**.

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.

- For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.
