Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the **preorder traversal** of a BST (i.e., **binary search tree**), construct the tree and return its root.

It is **guaranteed** that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.

A **binary search tree** is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of `Node.left` has a value **strictly less than** `Node.val`, and any descendant of `Node.right` has a value **strictly greater than** `Node.val`.

A **preorder traversal** of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses `Node.left`, then traverses `Node.right`.
