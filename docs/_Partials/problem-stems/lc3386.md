You are given a 2D array `events` which represents a sequence of events where a child pushes a series of buttons on a keyboard.

Each <code>events[i] = [index<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the button at index <code>index<sub>i</sub></code> was pressed at time <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>.

- The array is **sorted** in increasing order of `time`.
- The time taken to press a button is the difference in time between consecutive button presses. The time for the first button is simply the time at which it was pressed.

Return the `index` of the button that took the **longest** time to push. If multiple buttons have the same longest time, return the button with the **smallest** `index`.
