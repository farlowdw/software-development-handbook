Given a string `s`, your task is to find the length of the **longest self-contained** substring of `s`.

A substring `t` of a string `s` is considered **self-contained** if `t != s` and for every character in `t`, it doesn't exist in the *rest* of `s`.

Return the length of the longest self-contained substring of `s` if it exists, otherwise, return `-1`.
