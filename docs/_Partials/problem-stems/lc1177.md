Given a string `s`, we make queries on substrings of `s`.

For each query `queries[i] = [left, right, k]`, we may **rearrange** the substring `s[left], ..., s[right]`, and then choose **up to** `k` of them to replace with any lowercase English letter. 

If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.

Return an array `answer[]`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `i`th query `queries[i]`.

Note that: Each letter is counted **individually** for replacement so if for example `s[left..right] = "aaa"`, and `k = 2`, we can only replace two of the letters.  (Also, note that the initial string `s` is never modified by any query.)
