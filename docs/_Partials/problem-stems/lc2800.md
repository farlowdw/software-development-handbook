Given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, your task is to find a string that has the **minimum** length and contains all three strings as **substrings**.

If there are multiple such strings, return the **lexicographically smallest** one.

Return a string denoting the answer to the problem.

**Notes**

- A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears **earlier** in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.
- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
