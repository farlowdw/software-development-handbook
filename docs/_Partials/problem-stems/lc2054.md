You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array of `events` where <code>events[i] = [startTime<sub>i</sub>, endTime<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The `i`th event starts at <code>startTime<sub>i</sub></code> and ends at <code>endTime<sub>i</sub></code>, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>. You can choose **at most two non-overlapping** events to attend such that the sum of their values is **maximized**.

Return this **maximum** sum.

Note that the start time and end time is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time `t`, the next event must start at or after `t + 1`.
