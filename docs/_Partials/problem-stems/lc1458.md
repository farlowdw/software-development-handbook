Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

Return the maximum dot product between **non-empty** subsequences of `nums1` and `nums2` with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).
