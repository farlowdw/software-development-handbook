In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `i`th node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)`th node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

- For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list.
