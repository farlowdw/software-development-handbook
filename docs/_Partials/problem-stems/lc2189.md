You are given an integer `n` representing the number of playing cards you have. A **house of cards** meets the following conditions:

- A **house of cards** consists of one or more rows of **triangles** and horizontal cards.
- **Triangles** are created by leaning two cards against each other.
- One card must be placed horizontally between **all adjacent** triangles in a row.
- Any triangle on a row higher than the first must be placed on a horizontal card from the previous row.
- Each triangle is placed in the **leftmost** available spot in the row.

Return the number of **distinct house of cards** you can build using **all** `n` cards. Two houses of cards are considered distinct if there exists a row where the two houses contain a different number of cards.
