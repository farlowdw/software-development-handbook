There is a line chart consisting of `n` points connected by line segments. You are given a **1-indexed** integer array `y`. The `k`th point has coordinates `(k, y[k])`. There are no horizontal lines; that is, no two consecutive points have the same y-coordinate.

We can draw an infinitely long horizontal line. Return the **maximum** number of points of intersection of the line with the chart.
