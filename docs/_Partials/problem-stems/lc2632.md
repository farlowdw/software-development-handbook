Given a function `fn`, return a **curried** version of that function.

A **curried** function is a function that accepts fewer or an equal number of parameters as the original function and returns either another **curried** function or the same value the original function would have returned.

In practical terms, if you called the original function like sum(1,2,3), you would call the **curried** version like `csum(1)(2)(3)`, `csum(1)(2,3)`, `csum(1,2)(3)`, or `csum(1,2,3)`. All these methods of calling the **curried** function should return the same value as the original.
