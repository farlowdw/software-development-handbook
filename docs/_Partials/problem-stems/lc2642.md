There is a **directed weighted** graph that consists of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges of the graph are initially represented by the given array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, edgeCost<sub>i</sub>]</code> meaning that there is an edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with the cost <code>edgeCost<sub>i</sub></code>.

Implement the `Graph` class:

- `Graph(int n, int[][] edges)` initializes the object with `n` nodes and the given edges.
- `addEdge(int[] edge)` adds an edge to the list of edges where `edge = [from, to, edgeCost]`. It is guaranteed that there is no edge between the two nodes before adding this one.
- `int shortestPath(int node1, int node2)` returns the **minimum** cost of a path from `node1` to `node2`. If no path exists, return `-1`. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.
