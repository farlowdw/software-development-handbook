A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences. Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` are **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence **(possibly empty)** inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. For example, `sentence1 = "Hello my name is Jane"` and `sentence2 = "Hello Jane"` can be made equal by inserting `"my name is"` between `"Hello"` and `"Jane"` in `sentence2`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return `true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar. Otherwise, return `false`.
