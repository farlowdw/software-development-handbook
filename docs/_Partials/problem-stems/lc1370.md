Given a string `s`. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:

1. Pick the **smallest** character from `s` and **append** it to the result.
2. Pick the **smallest** character from `s` which is greater than the last appended character to the result and **append** it.
3. Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
4. Pick the largest character from `s` and **append** it to the result.
5. Pick the largest character from `s` which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and **append** it.
6. Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
R7. epeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from `s`.

In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.

Return the result string after sorting `s` with this algorithm.
