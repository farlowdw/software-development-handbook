We have `n` chips, where the position of the `i`th chip is `position[i]`.

We need to move all the chips to **the same position**. In one step, we can change the position of the `i`th chip from `position[i]` to:

- `position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`.
- `position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1`.

Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.
