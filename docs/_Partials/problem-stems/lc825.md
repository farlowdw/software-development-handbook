Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the `i`th person. 

Person `A` will NOT friend request person `B` (`B != A`) if any of the following conditions are true:

- `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
- `age[B] > age[A]`
- `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Otherwise, `A` will friend request `B`.

Note that if `A` requests `B`, `B` does not necessarily request `A`. Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?
