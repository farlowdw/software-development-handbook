You are given a 2D integer array of student data `students`, where `students[i] = [student_id, bench_id]` represents that student `student_id` is sitting on the bench `bench_id`.

Return the **maximum** number of *unique* students sitting on any single bench. If no students are present, return `0`.

**Note:** A student can appear multiple times on the same bench in the input, but they should be counted only once per bench.
