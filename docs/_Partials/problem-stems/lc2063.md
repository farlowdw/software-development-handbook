Given a string `word`, return the **sum of the number of vowels** (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`) in every substring of `word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

**Note:** Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.
