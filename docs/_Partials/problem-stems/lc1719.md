You are given an array `pairs`, where <code>pairs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>, and:

- There are no duplicates.
- <code>x<sub>i</sub> &lt; y<sub>i</sub></code>

Let `ways` be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:

- The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in `pairs`.
- A pair <code>[x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> exists in `pairs` **if and only if** <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> is an ancestor of <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> or <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> is an ancestor of <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>.
- **Note:** the tree does not have to be a binary tree.

Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:

- `0` if `ways == 0`
- `1` if `ways == 1`
- `2` if `ways > 1`

A **rooted tree** is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An **ancestor** of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.
