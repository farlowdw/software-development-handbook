Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for `Node` is below:

```
class Node {
  public int val;
  public Node left;
  public Node right;
  public Node parent;
}
```

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a tree `T` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."
