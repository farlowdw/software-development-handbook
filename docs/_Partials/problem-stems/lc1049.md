You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `i`th stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return `0`.
