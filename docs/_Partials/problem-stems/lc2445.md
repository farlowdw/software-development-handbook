There is an **undirected** connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n` and `n - 1` edges. You are given the integer `n`. The parent node of a node with a label `v` is the node with the label `floor(v / 2)`. The root of the tree is the node with the label `1`.

- For example, if `n = 7`, then the node with the label `3` has the node with the label `floor(3 / 2) = 1` as its parent, and the node with the label `7` has the node with the label `floor(7 / 2) = 3` as its parent.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. Initially, every node has a value `0` on it. For each query `queries[i]`, you should flip all values in the subtree of the node with the label `queries[i]`.

Return the total number of nodes with the value `1` **after processing all the queries**.

**Note** that:

- Flipping the value of a node means that the node with the value `0` becomes `1` and vice versa.
- `floor(x)` is equivalent to rounding x down to the nearest integer.
