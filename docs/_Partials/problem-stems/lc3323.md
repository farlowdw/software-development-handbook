You are given a 2D array `intervals`, where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the start and the end of interval `i`. You are also given an integer `k`.

You must add **exactly one** new interval <code>[start<sub>new</sub>, end<sub>new</sub>]</code> to the array such that:

- The length of the new interval, <code>end<sub>new</sub> - start<sub>new</sub></code>, is at most `k`.
- After adding, the number of **connected groups** in `intervals` is **minimized**.

A **connected group** of intervals is a maximal collection of intervals that, when considered together, cover a continuous range from the smallest point to the largest point with no gaps between them. Here are some examples:

- A group of intervals `[[1, 2], [2, 5], [3, 3]]` is connected because together they cover the range from `1` to `5` without any gaps.
- However, a group of intervals `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` is not connected because the segment `(2, 3)` is not covered.

Return the **minimum** number of connected groups after adding **exactly one** new interval to the array.
