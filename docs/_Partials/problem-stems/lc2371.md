You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` containing **distinct** positive integers.

You have to replace each integer in the matrix with a positive integer satisfying the following conditions:

- The **relative** order of every two elements that are in the same row or column should stay the **same** after the replacements.
- The **maximum** number in the matrix after the replacements should be as **small** as possible.

The relative order stays the same if for all pairs of elements in the original matrix such that <code>grid[r<sub>1</sub>][c<sub>1</sub>] > grid[r<sub>2</sub>][c<sub>2</sub>]</code> where either <code>r<sub>1</sub> == r<sub>2</sub></code> or <code>c<sub>1</sub> == c<sub>2</sub></code>, then it must be true that <code>grid[r<sub>1</sub>][c<sub>1</sub>] > grid[r<sub>2</sub>][c<sub>2</sub>]</code> after the replacements.

For example, if grid = [[2, 4, 5], [7, 3, 9]] then a good replacement could be either grid = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 4]] or grid = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 1, 4]].

Return the **resulting** matrix. If there are multiple answers, return **any** of them.
