You are given an integer array `nums`, and you can perform the following operation **any** number of times on `nums`:

- Swap the positions of two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` if `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1` where `gcd(nums[i], nums[j])` is the greatest common divisor of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

Return `true` if it is possible to sort `nums` in **non-decreasing** order using the above swap method, or `false` otherwise.
