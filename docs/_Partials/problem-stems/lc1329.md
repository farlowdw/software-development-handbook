A **matrix diagonal** is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the **matrix diagonal** starting from `mat[2][0]`, where `mat` is a `6 x 3` matrix, includes cells `mat[2][0]`, `mat[3][1]`, and `mat[4][2]`.

Given an `m x n` matrix `mat` of integers, sort each **matrix diagonal** in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.
