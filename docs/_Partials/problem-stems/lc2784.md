You are given an integer array `nums`. We consider an array **good** if it is a permutation of an array `base[n]`.

`base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n]` (in other words, it is an array of length `n + 1` which contains `1` to `n - 1` exactly once, plus two occurrences of `n`). For example, `base[1] = [1, 1]` and `base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]`.

Return `true` if the given array is good, otherwise return `false`.

**Note:** A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.
