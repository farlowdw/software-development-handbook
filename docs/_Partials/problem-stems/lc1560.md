Given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. We have a circular track which consists of `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The `i`th round starts at sector `rounds[i - 1]` and ends at sector `rounds[i]`. For example, round `1` starts at sector `rounds[0]` and ends at sector `rounds[1]`.

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in **ascending** order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
