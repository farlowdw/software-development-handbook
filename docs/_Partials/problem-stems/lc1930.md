Given a string `s`, return the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of `s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of <code>"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>"</code>.
