Consider a directed graph, with nodes labelled `0, 1, ..., n-1`.  In this graph, each edge is either red or blue, and there could be self-edges or parallel edges.

Each `[i, j]` in `red_edges` denotes a red directed edge from node `i` to node `j`.  Similarly, each `[i, j]` in `blue_edges` denotes a blue directed edge from node `i` to node `j`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where each `answer[X]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `X` such that the edge colors alternate along the path (or `-1` if such a path doesn't exist).
