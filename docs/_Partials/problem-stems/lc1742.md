You are working in a ball factory where you have `n` balls numbered from `lowLimit` up to `highLimit` inclusive (i.e., `n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1`), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from `1` to `infinity`.

Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number `321` will be put in the box number `3 + 2 + 1 = 6` and the ball number `10` will be put in the box number `1 + 0 = 1`.

Given two integers `lowLimit` and `highLimit`, return *the number of balls in the box with the most balls*.
