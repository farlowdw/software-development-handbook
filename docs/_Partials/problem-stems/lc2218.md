There are `n` **piles** of coins on a table. Each pile consists of a **positive number** of coins of assorted denominations.

In one move, you can choose any coin on **top** of any pile, remove it, and add it to your wallet.

Given a list `piles`, where `piles[i]` is a list of integers denoting the composition of the `i`th pile from **top to bottom**, and a positive integer `k`, return the **maximum total value** of coins you can have in your wallet if you choose **exactly** `k` coins optimally.
