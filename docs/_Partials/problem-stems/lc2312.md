You are given two integers `m` and `n` that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array prices, where <code>prices[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> and width <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>price<sub>i</sub></code> dollars.

To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the **entire** height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to `prices`. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you **cannot** rotate a piece to swap its height and width.

Return the **maximum** money you can earn after cutting an `m x n` piece of wood.

Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.
