You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer `1` and you want to reach the integer `target`.

In one move, you can either:

- **Increment** the current integer by one (i.e., `x = x + 1`).
- **Double** the current integer (i.e., `x = 2 * x`).

You can use the **increment** operation **any** number of times, however, you can only use the **double** operation **at most** `maxDoubles` times.

Given the two integers `target` and `maxDoubles`, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach `target` starting with `1`.
