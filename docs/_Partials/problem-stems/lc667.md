Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following requirement: Suppose this list is <code>[a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>]</code>, then the list <code>[|a<sub>1</sub> - a<sub>2</sub>|, |a<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>3</sub>|, |a<sub>3</sub> - a<sub>4</sub>|, ... , |a<sub>n-1</sub> - a<sub>n</sub>|]</code> has exactly `k` distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
