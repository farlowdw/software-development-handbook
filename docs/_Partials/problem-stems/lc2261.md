Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`, return the number of **distinct subarrays** which have **at most** `k` elements divisible by `p`.

Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are said to be **distinct** if:

- They are of **different** lengths, or
- There exists **at least** one index `i` where `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

A **subarray** is defined as a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
