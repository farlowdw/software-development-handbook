We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

- For example, `"abc"` can be shifted to be `"bcd"`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

- For example, we can keep shifting `"abc"` to form the sequence: `"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"`.

Given an array of strings `strings`, group all `strings[i]` that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in **any order**.
