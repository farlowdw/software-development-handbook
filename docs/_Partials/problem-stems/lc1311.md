There are `n` people, each person has a unique id between `0` and `n-1`. Given the arrays `watchedVideos` and `friends`, where `watchedVideos[i]` and `friends[i]` contain the list of watched videos and the list of friends respectively for the person with `id = i`.

Level **1** of videos are all watched videos by your friends, level **2** of videos are all watched videos by the friends of your friends and so on. In general, the level `k` of videos are all watched videos by people with the shortest path **exactly** equal to `k` with you. Given your `id` and the `level` of videos, return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). For videos with the same frequency order them alphabetically from least to greatest.
