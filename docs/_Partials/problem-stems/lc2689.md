You are given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `k`. Besides the left and right children, every node of this tree has two other properties, a **string** `node.val` containing only lowercase English letters (possibly empty) and a non-negative integer `node.len`. There are two types of nodes in this tree:

- **Leaf:** These nodes have no children, `node.len = 0`, and `node.val` is some **non-empty** string.
- **Internal:** These nodes have at least one child (also at most two children), `node.len > 0`, and `node.val` is an **empty** string.

The tree described above is called a Rope binary tree. Now we define `S[node]` recursively as follows:

- If `node` is some leaf node, `S[node] = node.val`,
- Otherwise if `node` is some internal node, `S[node] = concat(S[node.left], S[node.right])`.

Return k-th character of the string `S[root]`.

**Note:** If `s` and `p` are two strings, `concat(s, p)` is a string obtained by concatenating `p` to `s`. For example, `concat("ab", "zz") = "abzz"`.
