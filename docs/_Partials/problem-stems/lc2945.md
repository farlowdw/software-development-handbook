You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

You can perform any number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a **subarray** of the array and replacing it with the **sum** of its elements. For example, if the given array is `[1,3,5,6]` and you select subarray `[3,5]` the array will convert to `[1,8,6]`.

Return the **maximum** length of a **non-decreasing** array that can be made after applying operations.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.
