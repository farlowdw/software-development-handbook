There is a stream of `n` `(idKey, value)` pairs arriving in an **arbitrary** order, where `idKey` is an integer between `1` and `n` and `value` is a string. No two pairs have the same `id`.

Design a stream that returns the values in **increasing order of their IDs** by returning a **chunk** (list) of values after each insertion. The concatenation of all the **chunks** should result in a list of the sorted values.

Implement the `OrderedStream` class:

- `OrderedStream(int n)` Constructs the stream to take `n` values.
- `String[] insert(int idKey, String value)` Inserts the pair `(idKey, value)` into the stream, then returns the **largest possible chunk** of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.
