Implement a thread-safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:

- `BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity)` The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum `capacity`.
- `void enqueue(int element)` Adds an `element` to the front of the queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full.
- `int dequeue()` Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it. If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.
- `int size()` Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.

Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the `enqueue` method or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the `dequeue` method. The `size` method will be called after every test case.

Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.
