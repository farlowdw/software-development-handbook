You are given a positive integer `n` which is the number of nodes of a **0-indexed directed weighted** graph and a **0-indexed 2D array** `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given a node `s` and a node array `marked`; your task is to find the **minimum** distance from `s` to **any** of the nodes in `marked`.

Return an integer denoting the minimum distance from s to any node in `marked` or `-1` if there are no paths from s to any of the marked nodes.
