There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers `colors` and an integer `k`. The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:

- `colors[i] == 0` means that tile `i` is **red**.
- `colors[i] == 1` means that tile `i` is **blue**.

An **alternating** group is every `k` contiguous tiles in the circle with **alternating** colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its **left** and **right** tiles).

Return the number of **alternating** groups.

**Note** that since `colors` represents a **circle**, the **first** and the **last** tiles are considered to be next to each other.
