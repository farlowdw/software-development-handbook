A website domain like `"discuss.leetcode.com"` consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have `"com"`, at the next level, we have `"leetcode.com"`, and at the lowest level, `"discuss.leetcode.com"`. When we visit a domain like `"discuss.leetcode.com"`, we will also visit the parent domains `"leetcode.com"` and `"com"` implicitly.

Now, call a `"count-paired domain"` to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be `"9001 discuss.leetcode.com"`.

We are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.
