Given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(A, B)` and its **top-right** corner **(C, D)**.

The second rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner **(E, F)** and its **top-right** corner **(G, H)**.
