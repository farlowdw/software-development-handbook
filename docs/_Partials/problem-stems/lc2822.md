Given an object `obj`, return an inverted object `invertedObj`.

The `invertedObj` should have the keys of `obj` as values and the values of `obj` as keys. It is guaranteed that the values in `obj` are only strings. The function should handle duplicates, meaning that if there are multiple keys in `obj` with the same value, the `invertedObj` should map the value to an array containing all corresponding keys.
