Design a data structure that keeps track of the values in it and answers some queries regarding their frequencies.

Implement the `FrequencyTracker` class.

- `FrequencyTracker()`: Initializes the `FrequencyTracker` object with an empty array initially.
- `void add(int number)`: Adds `number` to the data structure.
- `void deleteOne(int number)`: Deletes **one** occurence of `number` from the data structure. The data structure **may not contain** `number`, and in this case nothing is deleted.
- `bool hasFrequency(int frequency)`: Returns `true` if there is a number in the data structure that occurs `frequency` number of times, otherwise, it returns `false`.
