You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red**, **Yellow**, or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
