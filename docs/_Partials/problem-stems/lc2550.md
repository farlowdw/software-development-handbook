There is a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices. The vertices are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has **exactly one monkey**. The following figure shows a convex polygon of `6` vertices.

<div align='center' class='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='250px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/2550-f1.png').default} />
</div>

Each monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex for a vertex `i` can be:

- the vertex `(i + 1) % n` in the clockwise direction, or
- the vertex `(i - 1 + n) % n` in the counter-clockwise direction.

A **collision** happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement.

Return the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least **one collision** happens. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that each monkey can only move once.
