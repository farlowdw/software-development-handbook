There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.
