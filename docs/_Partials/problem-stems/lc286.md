You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

- `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
- `0` A gate.
- `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value <code>2<sup>31</sup> - 1 = 2147483647</code> to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.
