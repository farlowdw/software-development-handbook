Given an array of strings `names` of size `n`. You will create `n` folders in your file system **such that**, at the `i`th minute, you will create a folder with the name `names[i]`.

Since two files **cannot** have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of `(k)`, where, `k` is the **smallest positive integer** such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the actual name the system will assign to the `i`th folder when you create it.
