You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array shifts where <code>shifts[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, direction<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For every `i`, **shift** the characters in `s` from the index <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to the index <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> (**inclusive**) forward if <code>direction<sub>i</sub> = 1</code>, or shift the characters backward if <code>direction<sub>i</sub> = 0</code>.

Shifting a character **forward** means replacing it with the **next** letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). Similarly, shifting a character **backward** means replacing it with the **previous** letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'a'` becomes `'z'`).

Return the final string after all such shifts to `s` are applied.
