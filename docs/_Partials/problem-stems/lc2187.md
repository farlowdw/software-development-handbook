You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `i`th bus to complete **one trip**.

Each bus can make multiple trips **successively**; that is, the next trip can start **immediately after** completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates **independently**; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make **in total**. Return the **minimum time** required for all buses to complete **at least** `totalTrips` trips.
