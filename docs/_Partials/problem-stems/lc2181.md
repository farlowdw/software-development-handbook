You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of integers **separated** by `0`'s. The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For **every** two consecutive `0`'s, **merge** all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the **sum** of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.

Return the `head` of the modified linked list.
