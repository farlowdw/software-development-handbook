In a string composed of `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'` characters, like `"RXXLRXRXL"`, a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of `"XL"` with `"LX"`, or replacing one occurrence of `"RX"` with `"XR"`. Given the starting string start and the ending string `end`, return `True` if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.
