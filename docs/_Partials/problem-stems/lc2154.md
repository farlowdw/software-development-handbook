You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.

You then do the following steps:

1. If `original` is found in `nums`, **multiply** it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).
2. Otherwise, **stop** the process.
3. **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.

Return the **final** value of `original`.
