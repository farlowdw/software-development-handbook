A sequence of numbers is called **arithmetic** if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence `s` is arithmetic if and only if `s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0]` for all valid `i`.

For example, these are **arithmetic** sequences:

```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```

The following sequence is not **arithmetic**:

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```

You are given an array of `n` integers, `nums`, and two arrays of `m` integers each, `l` and `r`, representing the `m` range queries, where the `i`th query is the range `[l[i], r[i]]`. All the arrays are **0-indexed**.

Return a list of `boolean` elements `answer`, where `answer[i]` is true if the subarray `nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]` can be **rearranged** to form an **arithmetic** sequence, and `false` otherwise.
