There are `n` uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from `1` to `n`. You want to arrange the sticks such that **exactly** `k` sticks are **visible** from the left. A stick is **visible** from the left if there are no **longer** sticks to the **left** of it.

- For example, if the sticks are arranged <code>[<u>1</u>,<u>3</u>,2,<u>5</u>,4]</code>, then the sticks with lengths `1`, `3`, and `5` are visible from the left.

Given `n` and `k`, return the **number** of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
