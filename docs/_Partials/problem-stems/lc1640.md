You are given an array of **distinct** integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are **distinct**. Your goal is to form `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` **in any order**. However, you are **not** allowed to reorder the integers in each array `pieces[i]`.

Return `true` if it is possible to form the array `arr` from `pieces`. Otherwise, return `false`.
