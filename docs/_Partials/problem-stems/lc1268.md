Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return list of lists of the suggested `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed.
