You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of even length `n`.

You must remove `n / 2` elements from `nums1` and `n / 2` elements from `nums2`. After the removals, you insert the remaining elements of `nums1` and `nums2` into a set `s`.

Return the **maximum** possible size of the set `s`.
