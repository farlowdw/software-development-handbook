A cinema has `n` rows of seats, numbered from `1` to `n` and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from `1` to `10` as shown in the figure above.

Given the array `reservedSeats` containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, `reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]` means the seat located in row `3` and labelled with `8` is already reserved.

Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats **in one single row**. Seats across an aisle (such as `[3,3]` and `[3,4]`) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.
