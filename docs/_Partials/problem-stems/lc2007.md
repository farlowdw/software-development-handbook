An integer array `original` is transformed into a **doubled** array changed by appending **twice the value** of every element in `original`, and then randomly **shuffling** the resulting array.

Given an array `changed`, return `original` if `changed` is a **doubled** array. If `changed` is not a **doubled** array, return an empty array. The elements in `original` may be returned in **any** order.
