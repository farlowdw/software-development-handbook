You are given an integer `n` representing the number of players in a game and a 2D array `pick` where <code>pick[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that the player <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> picked a ball of color <code>y<sub>i</sub></code>.

Player `i` **wins** the game if they pick **strictly more** than `i` balls of the **same** color. In other words,

- Player 0 wins if they pick any ball.
- Player 1 wins if they pick at least two balls of the *same* color.
- ...
- Player `i` wins if they pick at least `i + 1` balls of the *same* color.

Return the number of players who **win** the game.

**Note** that *multiple* players can win the game.
