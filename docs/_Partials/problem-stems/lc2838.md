There is a battle and `n` heroes are trying to defeat `m` monsters. You are given two **1-indexed** arrays of **positive** integers `heroes` and `monsters` of length `n` and `m`, respectively. `heroes[i]` is the power of `i`th hero, and `monsters[i]` is the power of `i`th monster.

The `i`th hero can defeat the `j`th monster if `monsters[j] <= heroes[i]`.

You are also given a **1-indexed** array `coins` of length `m` consisting of **positive** integers. `coins[i]` is the number of coins that each hero earns after defeating the `i`th monster.

Return an array `ans` of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the **maximum** number of coins that the `i`th hero can collect from this battle.

**Notes**

- The health of a hero doesn't get reduced after defeating a monster.
- Multiple heroes can defeat a monster, but each monster can be defeated by a given hero only once.
