You are playing a solitaire game with **three piles** of stones of sizes `a`​​​​​​, `b`,​​​​​​ and `c`​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two **different non-empty** piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are **fewer than two non-empty** piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the **maximum score** you can get.
