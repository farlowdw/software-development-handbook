You are given a list of airline `tickets` where <code>tickets[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

- For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.
