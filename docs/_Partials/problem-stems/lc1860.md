You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the available memory in bits on two memory sticks. There is currently a faulty program running that consumes an increasing amount of memory every second.

At the `i`th second (starting from `1`), `i` bits of memory are allocated to the stick with **more available memory** (or from the first memory stick if both have the same available memory). If neither stick has at least `i` bits of available memory, the program **crashes**.

Return an array containing <code>[crashTime, memory1<sub>crash</sub>, memory2<sub>crash</sub>]</code>, where `crashTime` is the time (in seconds) when the program crashed and <code>memory1<sub>crash</sub></code> and <code>memory2<sub>crash</sub></code> are the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively.
