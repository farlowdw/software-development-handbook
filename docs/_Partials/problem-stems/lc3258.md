You are given a **binary** string `s` and an integer `k`.

A **binary string** satisfies the **k-constraint** if **either** of the following conditions holds:

- The number of `0`'s in the string is at most `k`.
- The number of `1`'s in the string is at most `k`.

Return an integer denoting the number of substrings of `s` that satisfy the **k-constraint**.
