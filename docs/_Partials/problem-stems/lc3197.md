You are given a 2D **binary** array `grid`. You need to find 3 **non-overlapping** rectangles having **non-zero** areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the `1`'s in `grid` lie inside these rectangles.

Return the **minimum** possible sum of the area of these rectangles.

**Note** that the rectangles are allowed to touch.
