You are playing a game of tag with your friends. In tag, people are divided into two teams: people who are "it", and people who are not "it". The people who are "it" want to catch as many people as possible who are not "it".

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `team` containing only zeros (denoting people who are **not** "it") and ones (denoting people who are "it"), and an integer `dist`. A person who is "it" at index `i` can catch any **one** person whose index is in the range `[i - dist, i + dist]` (**inclusive**) and is **not** "it".

Return the **maximum** number of people that the people who are "it" can catch.
