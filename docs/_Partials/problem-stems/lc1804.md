A trie (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

- `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- `int countWordsEqualTo(String word)` Returns the number of instances of the string `word` in the trie.
- `int countWordsStartingWith(String prefix)` Returns the number of strings in the trie that have the string `prefix` as a prefix.
- `void erase(String word)` Erases the string `word` from the trie.
