Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, an element `nums[i]` is considered **good** if it is strictly greater than the elements at indices `i - k` and `i + k` (if those indices exist). If neither of these indices exists, `nums[i]` is still considered good.

Return the sum of all the good elements in the array.
