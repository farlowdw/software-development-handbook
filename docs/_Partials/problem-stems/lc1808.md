You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You are asked to construct a positive integer `n` that satisfies the following conditions:

- The number of prime factors of `n` (not necessarily distinct) is **at most** `primeFactors`.
- The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized. Note that a divisor of `n` is **nice** if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For example, if `n = 12`, then its prime factors are `[2,2,3]`, then `6` and `12` are nice divisors, while `3` and `4` are not.

Return the number of nice divisors of `n`. Since that number can be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than `1` that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number `n` is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals `n`.
