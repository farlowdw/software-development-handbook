There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query, find the **minimum number of operations** required to make the weight of every edge on the path from <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value.

**Note** that:

- Queries are **independent** of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its **initial state** on each new query.

- The path from <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> is a sequence of **distinct** nodes starting with node <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and ending with node <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.
