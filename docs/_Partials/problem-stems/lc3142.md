You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. You need to check if each cell `grid[i][j]` is:

- Equal to the cell below it, i.e. `grid[i][j] == grid[i + 1][j]` (if it exists).
- Different from the cell to its right, i.e. `grid[i][j] != grid[i][j + 1]` (if it exists).

Return `true` if **all** the cells satisfy these conditions, otherwise, return `false`.
