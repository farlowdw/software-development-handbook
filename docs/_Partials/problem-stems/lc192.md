Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

- `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
- Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
- Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
