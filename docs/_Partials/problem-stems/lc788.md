`X` is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by `180` degrees, we get a valid number that is different from `X`.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. `0`, `1`, and `8` rotate to themselves; `2` and `5` rotate to each other (on this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words `2` or `5` gets mirrored); `6` and `9` rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number `N`, how many numbers `X` from `1` to `N` are good?
