Design a `Calculator` class. The class should provide the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It should also allow consecutive operations to be performed using method chaining. The `Calculator` class constructor should accept a number which serves as the initial value of result.

Your `Calculator` class should have the following methods:

- `add` - This method adds the given number `value` to the `result` and returns the updated `Calculator`.
- `subtract` - This method subtracts the given number `value` from the `result` and returns the updated `Calculator`.
- `multiply` - This method multiplies the `result`  by the given number `value` and returns the updated `Calculator`.
- `divide` - This method divides the `result` by the given number `value` and returns the updated `Calculator`. If the passed value is `0`, an error `"Division by zero is not allowed"` should be thrown.
- `power` - This method raises the `result` to the power of the given number `value` and returns the updated `Calculator`.
- `getResult` - This method returns the `result`.

Solutions within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual result are considered correct.
