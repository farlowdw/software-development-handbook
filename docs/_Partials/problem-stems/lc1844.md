You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` that has lowercase English letters in its **even** indices and digits in its **odd** indices.

There is a function `shift(c, x)`, where `c` is a character and `x` is a digit, that returns the `x`th character after `c`.

- For example, `shift('a', 5) = 'f'` and `shift('x', 0) = 'x'`.

For every **odd** index `i`, you want to replace the digit `s[i]` with `shift(s[i-1], s[i])`.

Return `s` after replacing all digits. It is **guaranteed** that `shift(s[i-1], s[i])` will never exceed `'z'`.
