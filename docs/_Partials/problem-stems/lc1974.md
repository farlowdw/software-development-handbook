There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'` arranged in a **circle** with a **pointer**. A character can **only** be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is **initially** pointing to the character `'a'`.

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

- Move the pointer one character **counterclockwise** or **clockwise**.
- Type the character the pointer is **currently** on.

Given a string `word`, return the **minimum** number of seconds to type out the characters in `word`.
