There are two mice and `n` different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index `i` (**0-indexed**) is:

- `reward1[i]` if the first mouse eats it.
- `reward2[i]` if the second mouse eats it.

You are given a positive integer array `reward1`, a positive integer array `reward2`, and a non-negative integer `k`.

Return **the maximum** points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly `k` types of cheese.
