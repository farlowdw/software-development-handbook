You are given an `image` that is represented by a binary matrix with `0` as a white pixel and `1` as a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represent the location of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.
