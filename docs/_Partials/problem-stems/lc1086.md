Given a list of the scores of different students, `items`, where <code>items[i] = [ID<sub>i</sub>, score<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents one score from a student with <code>ID<sub>i</sub></code>, calculate each student's **top five average**.

Return the answer as an array of pairs `result`, where <code>result[j] = [ID<sub>j</sub>, topFiveAverage<sub>j</sub>]</code> represents the student with <code>ID<sub>j</sub></code> and their **top five average**. Sort `result` by <code>ID<sub>j</sub></code> in **increasing order**.

A student's **top five average** is calculated by taking the sum of their top five scores and dividing it by `5` using **integer division**.
