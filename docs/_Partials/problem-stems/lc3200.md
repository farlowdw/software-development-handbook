You are given two integers `red` and `blue` representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the **same** color, and adjacent rows should have **different** colors.

Return the **maximum** height of the triangle that can be achieved.
