You are given an integer `n`. We say that two integers `x` and `y` form a prime number pair if:

- `1 <= x <= y <= n`
- `x + y == n`
- `x` and `y` are prime numbers

Return the 2D sorted list of prime number pairs <code>[x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The list should be sorted in increasing order of <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>. If there are no prime number pairs at all, return an empty array.

**Note:** A prime number is a natural number greater than `1` with only two factors, itself and `1`.
