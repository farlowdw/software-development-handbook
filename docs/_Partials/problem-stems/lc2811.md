You are given an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `m`. You need to determine if it is possible to split the array into `n` **non-empty** arrays by performing a series of steps.

In each step, you can select an existing array (which may be the result of previous steps) with a length of **at least two** and split it into **two** subarrays, if, **for each** resulting subarray, **at least** one of the following holds:

- The length of the subarray is one, or
- The sum of elements of the subarray is **greater than or equal** to `m`.

Return `true` if you can split the given array into `n` arrays, otherwise return `false`.

**Note:** A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
