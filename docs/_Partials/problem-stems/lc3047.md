There exist `n` rectangles in a 2D plane. You are given two **0-indexed** 2D integer arrays `bottomLeft` and `topRight`, both of size `n x 2`, where `bottomLeft[i]` and `topRight[i]` represent the **bottom-left** and **top-right** coordinates of the `i`th rectangle respectively.

You can select a region formed from the **intersection** of two of the given rectangles. You need to find the **largest** area of a **square** that can fit **inside** this region if you select the region optimally.

Return the **largest** possible area of a square, or `0` if there **do not** exist any intersecting regions between the rectangles.
