You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` **good** if its product can be represented as a product of one or more **distinct prime** numbers.

- For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
  + `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.
  + `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.

Return the number of different **good** subsets in `nums` **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **subset** of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
