A sequence <code>X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub></code> is Fibonacci-like if:

- `n >= 3`
- <code>X<sub>i</sub> + X<sub>i+1</sub> = X<sub>i+2</sub></code> for all `i + 2 &lt;= n`

Given a **strictly increasing** array `arr` of positive integers forming a sequence, return the **length** of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return `0`.

A subsequence is derived from another sequence `arr` by deleting any number of elements (including none) from `arr`, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3, 5, 8]` is a subsequence of `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
