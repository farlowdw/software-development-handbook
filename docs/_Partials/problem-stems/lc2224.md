You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two **24-hour times**.

24-hour times are formatted as `"HH:MM"`, where `HH` is between `00` and `23`, and `MM` is between `00` and `59`. The earliest 24-hour time is `00:00`, and the latest is `23:59`.

In one operation you can increase the time `current` by `1`, `5`, `15`, or `60` minutes. You can perform this operation **any** number of times.

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed to convert `current` to `correct`.
