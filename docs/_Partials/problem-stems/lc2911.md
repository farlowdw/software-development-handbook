Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, partition `s` into `k` **substrings** such that the sum of the number of letter changes required to turn each **substring** into a **semi-palindrome** is minimized.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of letter changes required.

**Notes**

- A string is a **palindrome** if it can be read the same way from left to right and right to left.
- A string with a length of `len` is considered a **semi-palindrome** if there exists a positive integer `d` such that `1 <= d < len` and `len % d == 0`, and if we take indices that have the same modulo by `d`, they form a **palindrome**. For example, `"aa"`, `"aba"`, `"adbgad"`, and, `"abab"` are semi-palindrome and `"a"`, `"ab"`, and, `"abca"` are not.
- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
