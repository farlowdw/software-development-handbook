**Function** `customInterval`

Given a function `fn`, a number `delay` and a number `period`, return a number `id`. `customInterval` is a function that should execute the provided function `fn` at intervals based on a linear pattern defined by the formula `delay + period * count`. The `count` in the formula represents the number of times the interval has been executed starting from an initial value of `0`.

**Function** `customClearInterval`

Given the `id`. `id` is the returned value from the function `customInterval`. `customClearInterval` should stop executing provided function `fn` at intervals.
