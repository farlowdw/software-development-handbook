You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You are asked to distribute this array into `k` subsets of **equal size** such that there are no two equal elements in the same subset.

A subset's **incompatibility** is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in that array.

Return the **minimum possible sum of incompatibilities** of the `k` subsets after distributing the array optimally, or return `-1` if it is not possible.

A subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.
