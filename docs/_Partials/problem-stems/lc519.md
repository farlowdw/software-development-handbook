You are given the number of rows `n_rows` and number of columns `n_cols` of a 2D binary matrix where all values are initially `0`. Write a function `flip` which chooses a `0` value [uniformly at random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution), changes it to `1`, and then returns the position `[row.id, col.id]` of that value. Also, write a function `reset` which sets all values back to `0`. **Try to minimize the number of calls to system's `Math.random()`** and optimize the time and space complexity.

**Note:**

- `1 <= n_rows, n_cols <= 10000`
- `0 <= row.id < n_rows and 0 <= col.id < n_cols`
- `flip` will not be called when the matrix has no `0` values left.
- The total number of calls to `flip` and `reset` will not exceed `1000`.
