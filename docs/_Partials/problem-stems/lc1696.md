You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You are initially standing at index `0`. In one move, you can jump at most `k` steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index `i` to any index in the range `[i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)]` inclusive.

You want to reach the last index of the array (index `n - 1`). Your **score** is the **sum** of all `nums[j]` for each index `j` you visited in the array.

Return the **maximum score** you can get.
