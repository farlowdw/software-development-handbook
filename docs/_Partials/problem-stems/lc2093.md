A series of highways connect `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `highways` where <code>highways[i] = [city1<sub>i</sub>, city2<sub>i</sub>, toll<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a highway that connects <code>city1<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>city2<sub>i</sub></code>, allowing a car to go from <code>city1<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>city2<sub>i</sub></code> **and vice versa** for a cost of <code>toll<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given an integer `discounts` which represents the number of discounts you have. You can use a discount to travel across the `i`th highway for a cost of <code>toll<sub>i</sub> / 2</code> (**integer division**). Each discount may only be used **once**, and you can only use at most **one** discount per highway.

Return the **minimum total cost** to go from city `0` to city `n - 1`, or -1 if it is not possible to go from city `0` to city `n - 1`.
