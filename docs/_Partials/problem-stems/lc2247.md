A series of highways connect `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `highways` where <code>highways[i] = [city1<sub>i</sub>, city2<sub>i</sub>, toll<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a highway that connects <code>city1<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>city2<sub>i</sub></code>, allowing a car to go from <code>city1<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>city2<sub>i</sub></code> and **vice versa** for a cost of <code>toll<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given an integer `k`. You are going on a trip that crosses **exactly** `k` highways. You may start at any city, but you may only visit each city **at most** once during your trip.

Return the **maximum** cost of your trip. If there is no trip that meets the requirements, return `-1`.
