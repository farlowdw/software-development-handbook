Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
