You are given positive integers `n` and `target`.

An array `nums` is **beautiful** if it meets the following conditions:

- `nums.length == n`.
- `nums` consists of pairwise **distinct positive** integers.
- There doesn't exist two **distinct** indices, `i` and `j`, in the range `[0, n - 1]`, such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`.

Return the **minimum** possible sum that a beautiful array could have.
