You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array `sticks`, where `sticks[i]` is the length of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths `x` and `y` into one stick by paying a cost of `x + y`. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.
