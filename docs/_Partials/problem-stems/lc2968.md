You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You can perform the following operation on the array **at most** `k` times:

- Choose any index `i` from the array and **increase** or **decrease** `nums[i]` by `1`.

The score of the final array is the **frequency** of the most frequent element in the array.

Return the **maximum** score you can achieve.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurences of that element in the array.
