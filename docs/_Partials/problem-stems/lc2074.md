You are given the `head` of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are **sequentially** assigned to **non-empty** groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, 4, ...`). The **length** of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,

- The `1st` node is assigned to the first group.
- The `2nd` and the 3rd nodes are assigned to the second group.
- The `4th`, `5th`, and `6th` nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.
Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to `1 + the length of the second to last group`.

**Reverse** the nodes in each group with an **even** length, and return the `head` of the modified linked list.
