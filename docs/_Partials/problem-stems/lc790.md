We have two types of tiles: a `2x1` domino shape, and an `"L"` tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

```
XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X
```

Given `N`, how many ways are there to tile a `2 x N` board? **Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)
