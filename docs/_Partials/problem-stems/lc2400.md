You are given two **positive** integers `startPos` and `endPos`. Initially, you are standing at position `startPos` on an **infinite** number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.

Given a positive integer `k`, return the number of **different** ways to reach the position `endPos` starting from `startPos`, such that you perform **exactly** `k` steps. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Two ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not exactly the same.

**Note** that the number line includes negative integers.
