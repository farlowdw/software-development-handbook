You are given two integers `n` and `maxValue`, which are used to describe an **ideal** array.

A **0-indexed** integer array `arr` of length `n` is considered **ideal** if the following conditions hold:

- Every `arr[i]` is a value from `1` to `maxValue`, for `0 <= i < n`.
- Every `arr[i]` is divisible by `arr[i - 1]`, for `0 < i < n`.

Return the number of **distinct** ideal arrays of length `n`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
