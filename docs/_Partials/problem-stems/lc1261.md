Given a binary tree with the following rules:

1. `root.val == 0`
2. If `treeNode.val == x` and `treeNode.left != null`, then `treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1`
3. If `treeNode.val == x` and `treeNode.right != null`, then `treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2`

Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all `treeNode.val` have been changed to `-1`.

You need to first recover the binary tree and then implement the `FindElements` class:

- `FindElements(TreeNode* root)` Initializes the object with a contamined binary tree, you need to recover it first.
- `bool find(int target)` Return if the `target` value exists in the recovered binary tree.
