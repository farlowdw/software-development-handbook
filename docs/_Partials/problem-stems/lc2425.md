You are given two **0-indexed** arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, consisting of non-negative integers. There exists another array, `nums3`, which contains the bitwise XOR of **all pairings** of integers between `nums1` and `nums2` (every integer in `nums1` is paired with every integer in `nums2` **exactly once**).

Return the **bitwise XOR** of all integers in `nums3`.
