You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`, both of length `n`. For the `i`th query, the element in `nums` at the index `removeQueries[i]` is removed, splitting `nums` into different segments.

A **segment** is a contiguous sequence of **positive** integers in `nums`. A **segment sum** is the sum of every element in a segment.

Return an integer array `answer`, of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **maximum** segment sum after applying the `i`th removal.

**Note:** The same index will **not** be removed more than once.
