```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tree;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  Tree (N int,P int);

INSERT INTO
  Tree (N, P)
VALUES
  ('1', '2'),
  ('3', '2'),
  ('6', '8'),
  ('9', '8'),
  ('2', '5'),
  ('8', '5'),
  ('5', 'None');
```

**Table:** `Tree`

```
+-------------+------+ 
| Column Name | Type | 
+-------------+------+ 
| N           | int  | 
| P           | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `N` is the column of unique values for this table.
- Each row includes `N` and `P`, where `N` represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and `P` is the parent of `N`.

Write a solution to find the node type of the Binary Tree. Output one of the following for each node:

- `Root`: if the node is the root node.
- `Leaf`: if the node is the leaf node.
- `Inner`: if the node is neither root nor leaf node.

Return the result table ordered by node value in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

- **Input:** 

```
Tree table:
+---+------+
| N | P    | 
+---+------+
| 1 | 2    |
| 3 | 2    | 
| 6 | 8    | 
| 9 | 8    | 
| 2 | 5    | 
| 8 | 5    | 
| 5 | null | 
+---+------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+---+-------+
| N | Type  | 
+---+-------+
| 1 | Leaf  | 
| 2 | Inner |
| 3 | Leaf  |
| 5 | Root  |
| 6 | Leaf  |
| 8 | Inner |
| 9 | Leaf  |    
+---+-------+
```

- **Explanation:** 
  + Node `5` is the root node since it has no parent node.
  + Nodes `1`, `3`, `6`, and `8` are leaf nodes because they don't have any child nodes.
  + Nodes `2`, `4`, and `7` are inner nodes as they serve as parents to some of the nodes in the structure.
