You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `land` where a `0` represents a hectare of forested land and a `1` represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist **entirely** of farmland. These rectangular areas are called **groups**. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is **not** four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

`land` can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of `land` is `(0, 0)` and the bottom right corner of `land` is `(m-1, n-1)`. Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each **group** of farmland. A **group** of farmland with a top left corner at <code>(r<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>)</code> and a bottom right corner at <code>(r<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>)</code> is represented by the 4-length array <code>[r<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>]</code>.

Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each **group** of farmland in `land`. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in **any order**.
