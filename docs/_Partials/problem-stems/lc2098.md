You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the **largest even sum** of any subsequence of nums that has a length of `k`.

Return this sum, or `-1` if such a sum does not exist.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
