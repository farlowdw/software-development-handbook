You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers. You can choose two indices `i` and `j`, such that `i != j`, and the sum of digits of the number `nums[i]` is equal to that of `nums[j]`.

Return the **maximum** value of `nums[i] + nums[j]` that you can obtain over all possible indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions.
