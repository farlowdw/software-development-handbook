We have an array `arr` of non-negative integers.

For every (contiguous) subarray `sub = [arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]]` (with `i <= j`), we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in `sub`, obtaining a result `arr[i] | arr[i + 1] | ... | arr[j]`.

Return the number of possible results. Results that occur more than once are only counted once in the final answer
