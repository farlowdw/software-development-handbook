Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, return `true` if `s` **matches** the `pattern`.

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`. A **bijective mapping** means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.
