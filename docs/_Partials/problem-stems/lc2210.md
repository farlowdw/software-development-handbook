You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. An index `i` is part of a **hill** in `nums` if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are smaller than `nums[i]`. Similarly, an index `i` is part of a **valley** in `nums` if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are larger than `nums[i]`. Adjacent indices `i` and `j` are part of the **same** hill or valley if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on **both** the left and right of the index.

Return the number of hills and valleys in `nums`.
