You are given 2 **positive** integers `l` and `r`. For any number `x`, all positive divisors of `x` except `x` are called the **proper divisors** of `x`.

A number is called **special** if it has exactly 2 **proper divisors**. For example:

- The number 4 is *special* because it has proper divisors 1 and 2.
- The number 6 is *not special* because it has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3.

Return the count of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that are **not special**.
