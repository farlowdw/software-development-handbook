Implement [`strStr()`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

Clarification:

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return `0` when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [`strstr()`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [`indexOf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).
