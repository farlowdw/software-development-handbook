Given a set of keywords `words` and a string `S`, make all appearances of all keywords in `S` bold. Any letters between `<b>` and `</b>` tags become bold.

The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of course the tags should form a valid combination.

For example, given that `words = ["ab", "bc"]` and `S = "aabcd"`, we should return `"a<b>abc</b>d"`. Note that returning `"a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d"` would use more tags, so it is incorrect.
