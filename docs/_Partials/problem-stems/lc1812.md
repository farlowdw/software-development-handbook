You are given `coordinates`, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. Below is a chessboard for your reference.

</p>

Return `true` if the square is white, and `false` if the square is black.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.
