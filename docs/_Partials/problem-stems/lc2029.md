Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of n stones, and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array `stones`, where `stones[i]` is the **value** of the `i`th stone.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice** starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from `stones`. The player who removes a stone **loses** if the **sum** of the values of **all removed stones** is divisible by `3`. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).

Assuming both players play **optimally**, return `true` if Alice wins and `false` if Bob wins.
