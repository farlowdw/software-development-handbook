You are given an integer `n`, a **0-indexed** string array `words`, and a **0-indexed binary** array `groups`, both arrays having length `n`.

You need to select the **longest subsequence** from an array of indices `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`, such that for the subsequence denoted as <code>[i<sub>0</sub>, i<sub>1</sub>, ..., i<sub>k - 1</sub>]</code> having length `k`, <code>groups[i<sub>j</sub>] != groups[i<sub>j + 1</sub>]</code>, for each `j` where <code>0 &lt; j + 1 &lt; k</code>.

Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices **(in order)** in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.

**Note:** strings in `words` may be **unequal** in length.
