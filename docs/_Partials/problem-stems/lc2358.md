You are given a positive integer array `grades` which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter **all** these students into a competition in **ordered** non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:

- The sum of the grades of students in the `i`th group is **less than** the sum of the grades of students in the `(i + 1)`th group, for all groups (except the last).
- The total number of students in the `i`th group is **less than** the total number of students in the `(i + 1)`th group, for all groups (except the last).

Return the **maximum** number of groups that can be formed.
