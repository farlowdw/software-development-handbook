A set of real numbers can be represented as the union of several disjoint intervals, where each interval is in the form `[a, b)`. A real number `x` is in the set if one of its intervals `[a, b)` contains `x` (i.e. `a <= x < b`).

You are given a **sorted** list of disjoint `intervals` intervals representing a set of real numbers as described above, where <code>intervals[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the interval <code>[a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>)</code>. You are also given another interval `toBeRemoved`.

Return the set of real numbers with the interval `toBeRemoved` **removed** from `intervals`. In other words, return the set of real numbers such that every `x` in the set is in `intervals` but **not** in `toBeRemoved`. Your answer should be a **sorted** list of disjoint intervals as described above.
