You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but **cannot handle more than one request at a time**. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:

- The `i`th (0-indexed) request arrives.
- If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
- If the `(i % k)`th server is available, assign the request to that server.
- Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from `0` if necessary). For example, if the `i`th server is busy, try to assign the request to the `(i+1)`th server, then the `(i+2)`th server, and so on.

You are given a **strictly increasing** array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `i`th request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the `i`th request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the **busiest server(s)**. A server is considered **busiest** if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.

Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the **busiest server(s)**. You may return the IDs in any order.
