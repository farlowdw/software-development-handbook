We are given a linked list with `head` as the first node.  Let's number the nodes in the list: `node_1, node_2, node_3, ...` etc.

Each node may have a next larger **value**: for `node_i`, `next_larger(node_i)` is the `node_j.val` such that `j > i`, `node_j.val > node_i.val`, and `j` is the smallest possible choice.  If such a `j` does not exist, the next larger value is `0`.

Return an array of integers `answer`, where `answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1})`.

Note that in the example **inputs** (not outputs) below, arrays such as `[2,1,5]` represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of `2`, second node value of `1`, and third node value of `5`.
