You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive integer `k`.

We call an index `i` in the range `k <= i < n - k` **good** if the following conditions are satisfied:

- The `k` elements that are just **before** the index `i` are in **non-increasing** order.
- The `k` elements that are just **after** the index `i` are in **non-decreasing** order.

Return an array of all good indices sorted in **increasing** order.
