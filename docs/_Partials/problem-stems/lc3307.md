Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given an integer array `operations`, where `operations[i]` represents the **type** of the `i`th operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform **all** operations in sequence:

- If `operations[i] == 0`, **append** a copy of `word` to itself.
- If `operations[i] == 1`, generate a new string by **changing** each character in `word` to its **next** character in the English alphabet, and **append** it to the original `word`. For example, performing the operation on `"c"` generates `"cd"` and performing the operation on `"zb"` generates `"zbac"`.

Return the value of the `k`th character in `word` after performing all the operations.

**Note** that the character `'z'` can be changed to `'a'` in the second type of operation.
