We run a preorder depth-first search (DFS) on the `root` of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output `D` dashes (where `D` is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  If the depth of a node is `D`, the depth of its immediate child is `D + 1`.  The depth of the `root` node is `0`.

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be **the left child**.

Given the output `S` of this traversal, recover the tree and return its `root`.
