You are given an `m x n` matrix board, representing the **current** state of a crossword puzzle. The crossword contains lowercase English letters (from solved words), `' '` to represent any **empty** cells, and `'#'` to represent any **blocked** cells.

A word can be placed **horizontally** (left to right **or** right to left) or vertically (top to bottom or bottom to top) in the board if:

- It does not occupy a cell containing the character `'#'`.
- The cell each letter is placed in must either be `' '` (empty) or **match** the letter already on the `board`.
- There must not be any empty cells `' '` or other lowercase letters **directly left or right** of the word if the word was placed **horizontally**.
- There must not be any empty cells `' '` or other lowercase letters **directly above or below** the word if the word was placed **vertically**.

Given a string `word`, return `true` if `word` can be placed in `board`, or `false` **otherwise**.
