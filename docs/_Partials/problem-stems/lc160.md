Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

<p align='center'>
  <img width="500px" src={require('@site/static/img/lc/160-f1.png').default} />
</p>

It is **guaranteed** that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.
