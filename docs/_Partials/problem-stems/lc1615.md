There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

The **network rank** of **two different cities** is defined as the total number of **directly** connected roads to **either** city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted **once**.

The **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure is the **maximum network rank** of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return the **maximal network rank** of the entire infrastructure.
