You are given an array of events where <code>events[i] = [startDay<sub>i</sub>, endDay<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> event starts at <code>startDay<sub>i</sub></code> and ends at <code>endDay<sub>i</sub></code>, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events.
