You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, their **importance value** and their **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee `1` is the leader of employee `2`, and employee `2` is the leader of employee `3`. They have importance value `15`, `10` and `5`, respectively. Then employee `1` has a data structure like `[1, 15, [2]]`, and employee `2` has `[2, 10, [3]]`, and employee `3` has `[3, 5, []]`. Note that although employee `3` is also a subordinate of employee `1`, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.
