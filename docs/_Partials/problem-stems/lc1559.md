Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the **same value** in `grid`.

A cycle is a path of **length 4 or more** in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the **same value** of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)` is invalid because from `(1, 2)` we visited `(1, 1)` which was the last visited cell.

Return `true` if any cycle of the same value exists in `grid`, otherwise, return `false`.
