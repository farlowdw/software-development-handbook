You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

You can apply the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose **any** subarray of size `k` from the array and **decrease** all its elements by `1`.

Return `true` if you can make all the array elements equal to `0`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.
