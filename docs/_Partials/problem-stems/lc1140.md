Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.  Initially, `M = 1`.

On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the first `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`.  Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.
