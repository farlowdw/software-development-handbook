You are given a **binary** string `s` and an integer `k`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

A **binary string** satisfies the **k-constraint** if **either** of the following conditions holds:

- The number of `0`'s in the string is at most `k`.
- The number of `1`'s in the string is at most `k`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of substrings of <code>s[l<sub>i</sub>..r<sub>i</sub>]</code> that satisfy the **k-constraint**.
