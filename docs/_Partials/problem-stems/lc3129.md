You are given 3 positive integers `zero`, `one`, and `limit`.

A binary array `arr` is called **stable** if:

- The number of occurrences of `0` in `arr` is **exactly** `zero`.
- The number of occurrences of `1` in `arr` is **exactly** `one`.
- Each subarray of `arr` with a size greater than `limit` must contain both `0` and `1`.

Return the total number of **stable** binary arrays.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
