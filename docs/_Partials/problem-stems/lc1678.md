You own a **Goal Parser** that can interpret a string `command`. The `command` consists of an alphabet of `"G"`, `"()"` and/or `"(al)"` in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret `"G"` as the string `"G"`, `"()"` as the string `"o"`, and `"(al)"` as the string `"al"`. The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.

Given the string `command`, return the **Goal Parser**'s interpretation of `command`.
