You are given an array of `n` integers, `nums`, where there are at most `50` unique values in the array. You are also given an array of `m` customer order quantities, `quantity`, where `quantity[i]` is the amount of integers the `i`th customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute `nums` such that:

- The `i`th customer gets **exactly** `quantity[i]` integers,
- The integers the `i`th customer gets are **all equal**, and
- Every customer is satisfied.

Return `true` if it is possible to distribute `nums` according to the above conditions.
