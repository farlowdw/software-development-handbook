You are given an integer `n`. Consider an equilateral triangle of side length `n`, broken up into <code>n<sup>2</sup></code> unit equilateral triangles. The triangle has `n` **1-indexed** rows where the `i`th row has `2i - 1` unit equilateral triangles.

The triangles in the `i`th row are also **1-indexed** with coordinates from `(i, 1)` to `(i, 2i - 1)`. The following image shows a triangle of side length `4` with the indexing of its triangle.

Two triangles are **neighbors** if they **share a side**. For example:

- Triangles `(1,1)` and `(2,2)` are neighbors
- Triangles `(3,2)` and `(3,3)` are neighbors.
- Triangles `(2,2)` and `(3,3)` are not neighbors because they do not share any side.

Initially, all the unit triangles are **white**. You want to choose `k` triangles and color them **red**. We will then run the following algorithm:

1. Choose a white triangle that has **at least two** red neighbors.
  + If there is no such triangle, stop the algorithm.
2. Color that triangle **red**.
3. Go to step 1.

Choose the minimum `k` possible and set `k` triangles red before running this algorithm such that after the algorithm stops, all unit triangles are colored red.

Return a 2D list of the coordinates of the triangles that you will color red initially. The answer has to be of the smallest size possible. If there are multiple valid solutions, return any.
