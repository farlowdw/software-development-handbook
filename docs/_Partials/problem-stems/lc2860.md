You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` where `n` is the total number of students in the class. The class teacher tries to select a group of students so that all the students remain happy.

The `i`th student will become happy if one of these two conditions is met:

- The student is selected and the total number of selected students is **strictly greater than** `nums[i]`.
- The student is not selected and the total number of selected students is **strictly less than** `nums[i]`.

Return the number of ways to select a group of students so that everyone remains happy.
