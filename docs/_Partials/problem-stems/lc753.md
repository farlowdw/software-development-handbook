There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be one of the first `k` digits `0, 1, ..., k-1`.

While entering a password, the last `n` digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is `"345"`, if you type `"012345"`, the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of **minimum length** that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.
