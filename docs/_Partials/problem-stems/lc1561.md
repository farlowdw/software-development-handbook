There are `3n` piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

- In each step, you will choose **any** `3` piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
- Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
- You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
- Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
- Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
