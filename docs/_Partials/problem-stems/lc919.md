A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Write a data structure `CBTInserter` that is initialized with a complete binary tree and supports the following operations:

- `CBTInserter(TreeNode root)` initializes the data structure on a given tree with head node `root`;
- `CBTInserter.insert(int v)` will insert a `TreeNode` into the tree with value `node.val = v` so that the tree remains complete, **and returns the value of the parent of the inserted `TreeNode`**;
- `CBTInserter.get_root()` will return the head node of the tree.
