You are given a floating-point number `hour`, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take `n` trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array `dist` of length `n`, where `dist[i]` describes the distance (in kilometers) of the `i`th train ride.

Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.

- For example, if the `1`st train ride takes `1.5` hours, you must wait for an additional `0.5` hours before you can depart on the `2`nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.

Return the **minimum positive integer** speed **(in kilometers per hour)** that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or `-1` if it is impossible to be on time.

Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed <code>10<sup>7</sup></code> and `hour` will have **at most two digits after the decimal point**.
