Given a `node` in a binary search tree, return the in-order successor of that node in the BST. If that node has no in-order successor, return `null`.

The successor of a `node` is the node with the smallest key greater than `node.val`.

You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for `Node`:

```
class Node {
  public int val;
  public Node left;
  public Node right;
  public Node parent;
}
```
