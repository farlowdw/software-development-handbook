You are given three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

An event is being held for `n` performers. When a performer arrives, they are **assigned** to one of the `x` stages. All performers assigned to the **same** stage will perform together as a band, though some stages might remain **empty**.

After all performances are completed, the jury will **award** each band a score in the range `[1, y]`.

Return the **total** number of possible ways the event can take place.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that two events are considered to have been held **differently** if **either** of the following conditions is satisfied:

- **Any** performer is assigned a different stage.
- **Any** band is awarded a different score.
