You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation you can replace any element of the array with **any two** elements that **sum** to it.

- For example, consider `nums = [5,6,7]`. In one operation, we can replace `nums[1]` with `2` and `4` and convert `nums` to `[5,2,4,7]`.

Return the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
