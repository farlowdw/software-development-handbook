Given `n` boxes, each box is given in the format `[status, candies, keys, containedBoxes]` where:

- `status[i]`: an integer which is **1** if `box[i]` is open and **0** if `box[i]` is closed.
- `candies[i]`: an integer representing the number of candies in `box[i]`.
- `keys[i]`: an array contains the indices of the boxes you can open with the key in `box[i]`.
- `containedBoxes[i]`: an array contains the indices of the boxes found in `box[i]`.

You will start with some boxes given in `initialBoxes` array. You can take all the candies in any open box and you can use the keys in it to open new boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.

Return the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules above.
