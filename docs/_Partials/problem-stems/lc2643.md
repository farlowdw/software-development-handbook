Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, find the **0-indexed** position of the row that contains the **maximum** count of **ones**, and the number of ones in that row.

In case there are multiple rows that have the maximum count of ones, the row with the **smallest row number** should be selected.

Return an array containing the index of the row, and the number of ones in it.
