To some string `S`, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has `3` parameters: a starting index `i`, a source word `x` and a target word `y`. The rule is that if `x` starts at position `i` in the **original string** `S`, then we will replace that occurrence of `x` with `y`. If not, we do nothing.

For example, if we have `S = "abcd"` and we have some replacement operation `i = 2`, `x = "cd"`, `y = "ffff"`, then because `"cd"` starts at position `2` in the original string `S`, we will replace it with `"ffff"`.

Using another example on `S = "abcd"`, if we have both the replacement operation `i = 0`, `x = "ab"`, `y = "eee"`, as well as another replacement operation `i = 2`, `x = "ec"`, `y = "ffff"`, this second operation does nothing because in the original string `S[2] = 'c'`, which doesn't match `x[0] = 'e'`.

All these operations occur simultaneously. It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, `S = "abc"`, `indexes = [0, 1]`, `sources = ["ab","bc"]` is not a valid test case.
