The **alternating sum** of a **0-indexed** array is defined as the **sum** of the elements at **even** indices **minus** the **sum** of the elements at **odd** indices.

- For example, the alternating sum of `[4,2,5,3]` is `(4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4`.

Given an array `nums`, return the **maximum alternating sum** of any subsequence of `nums` (after **reindexing** the elements of the subsequence).

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of <code>[4,<u>2</u>,3,<u>7</u>,2,1,<u>4</u>]</code> (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.
