You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up `2` cups with **different** types of water, or `1` cup of any type of water.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `amount` of length `3` where `amount[0]`, `amount[1]`, and `amount[2]` denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return the **minimum** number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.
