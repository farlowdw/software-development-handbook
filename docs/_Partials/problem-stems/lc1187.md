Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length` and do the assignment `arr1[i] = arr2[j]`.

If there is no way to make `arr1` strictly increasing, return `-1`.
