You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `numOperations`.

You must perform an **operation** `numOperations` times on `nums`, where in each operation you:

- Select an index `i` that was **not** selected in any previous operations.
- Add an integer in the range `[-k, k]` to `nums[i]`.

Return the **maximum** possible frequency of any element in `nums` after performing the **operations**.
