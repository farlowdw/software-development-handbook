You are given four integers `minLength`, `maxLength`, `oneGroup` and `zeroGroup`.

A binary string is **good** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- The length of the string is in the range `[minLength, maxLength]`.
- The size of each block of consecutive `1`'s is a multiple of `oneGroup`.
  + For example in a binary string <code>00<b><u>11</u></b>0<b><u>1111</u></b>00</code> sizes of each block of consecutive ones are <code>[2,4]</code>.
- The size of each block of consecutive `0`'s is a multiple of `zeroGroup`.
  + For example, in a binary string <code><b><u>00</u></b>11<b><u>0</u></b>1111<b><u>00</u></b></code> sizes of each block of consecutive ones are <code>[2,1,2]</code>.

Return the number of **good** binary strings. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that `0` is considered a multiple of all the numbers.
