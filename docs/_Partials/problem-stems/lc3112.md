There is an undirected graph of `n` nodes. You are given a 2D array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, length<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes an edge between node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with a traversal time of <code>length<sub>i</sub></code> units.

Additionally, you are given an array `disappear`, where `disappear[i]` denotes the time when the node `i` disappears from the graph and you won't be able to visit it.

**Notice** that the graph might be disconnected and might contain multiple edges.

Return the array `answer`, with `answer[i]` denoting the **minimum** units of time required to reach node `i` from node `0`. If node `i` is **unreachable** from node 0 then `answer[i]` is `-1`.
