We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one-letter string.

We are allowed to place any color block C on top of two adjacent blocks of colors `A` and `B`, if and only if `ABC` is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of `bottom`, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples `allowed`. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length `3`.

Return `true` if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise `false`.
