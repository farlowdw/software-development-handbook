You are given a **0-indexed** binary array `nums` of length `n`, a positive integer `k` and a non-negative integer `maxChanges`.

Dylan Smith plays a game, where the goal is for Dylan to pick up `k` ones from `nums` using the **minimum** number of **moves**. When the game starts, Dylan picks up any index `dylanIndex` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and stands there. If `nums[dylanIndex] == 1` , Dylan picks up the one and `nums[dylanIndex]` becomes `0` (this **does not** count as a move). After this, Dylan can make **any** number of **moves** (**including zero**) where in each move Dylan must perform **exactly** one of the following actions:

- Select any index `j != dylanIndex` such that `nums[j] == 0` and set `nums[j] = 1`. This action can be performed **at most** `maxChanges` times.
- Select any two adjacent indices `x` and `y` (`|x - y| == 1`) such that `nums[x] == 1`, `nums[y] == 0`, then swap their values (set `nums[y] = 1` and `nums[x] = 0`). If `y == dylanIndex`, Dylan picks up the one after this move and `nums[y]` becomes `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required by Dylan to pick **exactly** `k` ones.
