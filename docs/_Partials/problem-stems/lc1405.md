A string `s` is called **happy** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- `s` only contains the letters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- `s` does not contain any of `"aaa"`, `"bbb"`, or `"ccc"` as a substring.
- `s` contains **at most** `a` occurrences of the letter `'a'`.
- `s` contains **at most** `b` occurrences of the letter `'b'`.
- `s` contains **at most** `c` occurrences of the letter `'c'`.

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the **longest possible happy** string. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return any of them. If there is no such string, return the empty string `""`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
