You are given two **0-indexed** arrays of strings `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string consists of **lowercase English letters** only.

For each string in `targetWords`, check if it is possible to choose a string from `startWords` and perform a **conversion operation** on it to be equal to that from `targetWords`.

The **conversion operation** is described in the following two steps:

1. **Append** any lowercase letter that is **not present** in the string to its end.
  - For example, if the string is `"abc"`, the letters `'d'`, `'e'`, or `'y'` can be added to it, but not `'a'`. If `'d'` is added, the resulting string will be `"abcd"`.
2. **Rearrange** the letters of the new string in **any** arbitrary order.
  - For example, `"abcd"` can be rearranged to "acbd", "bacd", "cbda", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to `"abcd"` itself.

Return the **number of strings** in `targetWords` that can be obtained by performing the operations on **any** string of `startWords`.

**Note** that you will only be verifying if the string in `targetWords` can be obtained from a string in `startWords` by performing the operations. The strings in `startWords` **do not** actually change during this process.
