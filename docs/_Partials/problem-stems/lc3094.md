There is a number `n` between `0` and <code>2<sup>30</sup> - 1</code> (both inclusive) that you have to find.

There is a pre-defined API `int commonBits(int num)` that helps you with your mission. But here is the challenge, every time you call this function, `n` changes in some way. But keep in mind, that you have to find the **initial value of** `n`.

`commonBits(int num)` acts as follows:

- Calculate `count` which is the number of bits where both `n` and `num` have the same value in that position of their binary representation.
- `n = n XOR num`
- Return `count`.

Return the number `n`.

**Note:** In this world, all numbers are between `0` and <code>2<sup>30</sup> - 1</code> (both inclusive), thus for counting common bits, we see only the first 30 bits of those numbers.
