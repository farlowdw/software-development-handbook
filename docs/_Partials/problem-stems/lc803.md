You are given an `m x n` binary `grid`, where each `1` represents a brick and `0` represents an empty space. A brick is **stable** if:

- It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
- At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is **stable**.

You are also given an array `hits`, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location <code>hits[i] = (row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>)</code>. The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will **fall**. Once a brick falls, it is **immediately** erased from the `grid` (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

Return an array `result`, where each `result[i]` is the number of bricks that will **fall** after the `i`th erasure is applied.

**Note** that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.
