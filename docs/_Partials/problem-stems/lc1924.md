You are given a 2D integer array `trees` where <code>trees[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the location of the `i`th tree in the garden.

You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope possible. The garden is well-fenced only if **all the trees are enclosed** and the rope used **forms a perfect circle**. A tree is considered enclosed if it is inside or on the border of the circle.

More formally, you must form a circle using the rope with a center `(x, y)` and radius `r` where all trees lie inside or on the circle and `r` is **minimum**.

Return the center and radius of the circle as a length 3 array `[x, y, r]`. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.
