A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of `n` keys, one at a time.

You are given a string `keysPressed` of length `n`, where `keysPressed[i]` was the `i`th key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list `releaseTimes`, where `releaseTimes[i]` was the time the `i`th key was released. Both arrays are **0-indexed**. The `0`th key was pressed at the time `0`, and every subsequent key was pressed at the **exact** time the previous key was released.

The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the **longest duration**. The `i`th keypress had a **duration** of `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]`, and the `0`th keypress had a duration of `releaseTimes[0]`.

Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key **may not** have had the same **duration**.

Return the key of the keypress that had the **longest duration**. If there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses.
