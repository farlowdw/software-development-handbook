You have `n` data centers and need to upgrade their servers.

You are given four arrays `count`, `upgrade`, `sell`, and `money` of length `n`, which show:

- The number of servers
- The cost of upgrading a single server
- The money you get by selling a server
- The money you initially have

for each data center respectively.

Return an array `answer`, where for each data center, the corresponding element in `answer` represents the **maximum** number of servers that can be upgraded.

Note that the money from one data center **cannot** be used for another data center.
