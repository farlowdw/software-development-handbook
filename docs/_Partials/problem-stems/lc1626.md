You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the **sum** of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have **conflicts**. A **conflict** exists if a younger player has a **strictly higher** score than an older player. A conflict does **not** occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `i`th player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.
