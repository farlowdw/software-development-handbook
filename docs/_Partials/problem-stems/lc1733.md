On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer `n`, an array `languages`, and an array `friendships` where:

- There are `n` languages numbered `1` through `n`,
- `languages[i]` is the set of languages the `i`th user knows, and
- <code>friendships[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a friendship between the users <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

You can choose **one** language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the **minimum** number of users you need to teach.

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if `x` is a friend of `y` and `y` is a friend of `z`, this doesn't guarantee that `x` is a friend of `z`.
