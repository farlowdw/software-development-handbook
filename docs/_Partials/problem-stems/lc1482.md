Given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

We need to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` **adjacent flowers** from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `i`th flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in **exactly one** bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets return `-1`.
