Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of `s` and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of `t`. In other words, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in `t` by **exactly** one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in <code>"<u>compute</u>r"</code> and <code>"<u>computa</u>tion"</code> only differ by the `'e'`/`'a'`, so this is a valid way.

Return the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
