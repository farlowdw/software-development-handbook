Given a positive integer `n`, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer `n` and is greater in value than `n`. If no such positive integer exists, return `-1`.

**Note** that the returned integer should fit in **32-bit integer**, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in **32-bit integer**, return `-1`.
