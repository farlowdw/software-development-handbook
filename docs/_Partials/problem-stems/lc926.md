A string of `'0'`s and `'1'`s is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `'0'`s (possibly 0), followed by some number of `'1'`s (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string `S` of `'0'`s and `'1'`s, and we may flip any `'0'` to a `'1'` or a `'1'` to a `'0'`.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `S` monotone increasing.
