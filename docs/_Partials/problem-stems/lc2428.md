You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`.

We define an **hourglass** as a part of the matrix with the following form:

<div align='center'>
  <img width='250px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/2428-f1.png').default} />
</div>

Return the **maximum** sum of the elements of an hourglass.

**Note** that an hourglass cannot be rotated and must be entirely contained within the matrix.
