You are given a binary string `s`, and two integers `num1` and `num2`. `num1` and `num2` are coprime numbers.

A **ratio substring** is a substring of `s` where the ratio between the number of `0`'s and the number of `1`'s in the substring is exactly `num1 : num2`.

- For example, if `num1 = 2` and `num2 = 3`, then `"01011"` and `"1110000111"` are ratio substrings, while `"11000"` is not.

Return the number of **non-empty** ratio substrings of `s`.

**Note** that:

- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- Two values `x` and `y` are **coprime** if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
