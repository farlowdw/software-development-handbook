There are `n` tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array `tasks` of length `n`, where the `i`th task takes `tasks[i]` hours to finish. A **work session** is when you work for **at most** `sessionTime` consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

- If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the **same** work session.
- You can start a new task **immediately** after finishing the previous one.
- You may complete the tasks in **any order**.

Given `tasks` and `sessionTime`, return the **minimum** number of **work sessions** needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.

The tests are generated such that `sessionTime` is **greater** than or **equal** to the **maximum** element in `tasks[i]`.
