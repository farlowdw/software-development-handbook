A square matrix is said to be an **X-Matrix** if **both** of the following conditions hold:

1. All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are **non-zero**.
2. All other elements are `0`.

Given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a square matrix, return `true` if `grid` is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return `false`.
