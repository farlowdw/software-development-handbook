You are given an integer array `nums` and a **non-negative** integer `k`. In one operation, you can increase or decrease any element by `1`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make the **median** of `nums` equal to `k`.

The median of an array is defined as the middle element of the array when it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If there are two choices for a median, the larger of the two values is taken.
