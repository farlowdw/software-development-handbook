There are `n` houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `colors` of length `n`, where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `i`th house.

Return the **maximum** distance between **two** houses with **different** colors.

The distance between the `i`th and `j`th houses is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs(x)` is the **absolute value** of `x`.
