Given the root of a binary tree `root` where each node has a value, return the level of the tree that has the **minimum** sum of values among all the levels (in case of a tie, return the **lowest** level).

**Note** that the root of the tree is at level `1` and the level of any other node is its distance from the `root + 1`.
