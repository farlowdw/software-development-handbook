You are given an `n x n` `grid` where we place some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes that are axis-aligned with the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of the cell `(i, j)`.

We view the projection of these cubes onto the `xy`, `yz`, and `zx` planes.

A **projection** is like a shadow, that maps our **3-dimensional** figure to a **2-dimensional** plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.
