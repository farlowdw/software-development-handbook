You are given a **positive** integer `num` consisting of exactly four digits. Split `num` into two new integers `new1` and `new2` by using the **digits** found in `num`. **Leading zeros** are allowed in `new1` and `new2`, and **all** the digits found in `num` must be used.

- For example, given `num = 2932`, you have the following digits: two `2`'s, one `9` and one `3`. Some of the possible pairs `[new1, new2]` are `[22, 93]`, `[23, 92]`, `[223, 9]` and `[2, 329]`.

Return the **minimum** possible sum of `new1` and `new2`.
