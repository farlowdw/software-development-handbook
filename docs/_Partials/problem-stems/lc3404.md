You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

A **special subsequence** is defined as a subsequence of length `4`, represented by indices `(p, q, r, s)`, where `p < q < r < s`. This subsequence must satisfy the following conditions:

- `nums[p] * nums[r] == nums[q] * nums[s]`
- There must be at least one element between each pair of indices. In other words, `q - p > 1`, `r - q > 1` and `s - r > 1`.

A subsequence is a sequence derived from the array by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Return the number of different **special subsequences** in `nums`.
