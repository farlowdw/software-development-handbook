Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at **vertex 0** and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that exists an edge connecting the vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.
