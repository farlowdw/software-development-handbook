You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

**Swaps** of **adjacent** elements are able to be performed on `nums`.

A **valid** array meets the following conditions:

- The largest element (any of the largest elements if there are multiple) is at the rightmost position in the array.
- The smallest element (any of the smallest elements if there are multiple) is at the leftmost position in the array.

Return the **minimum** swaps required to make `nums` a valid array.
