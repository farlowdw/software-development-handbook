You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, `freq[a] - freq[b]`, in a substring subs of `s`, such that:

- `subs` has a size of at least `k`.
- Character `a` has an odd frequency in `subs`.
- Character `b` has an even frequency in `subs`.

Return the maximum difference.

Note that `subs` can contain more than 2 distinct characters.
