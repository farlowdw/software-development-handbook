Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on a list in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

- `PeekingIterator(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer array `nums`.
- `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
- `bool hasNext()` Returns true if there are still elements in the array.
- `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.
