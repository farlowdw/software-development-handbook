Given an array of **distinct** integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements. 

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair `[a, b]` follows

- `a, b` are from `arr`
- `a < b`
- `b - a` equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`
