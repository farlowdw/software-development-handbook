**Table:** `Tasks`

```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| task_id        | int     |
| subtasks_count | int     |
+----------------+---------+
```

- `task_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table indicates that `task_id` was divided into `subtasks_count` subtasks labelled from `1` to `subtasks_count`.
- It is guaranteed that `2 <= subtasks_count <= 20`.

**Table:** `Executed`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| task_id       | int     |
| subtask_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

- `(task_id, subtask_id)` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table indicates that for the task `task_id`, the subtask with ID `subtask_id` was executed successfully.
- It is **guaranteed** that `subtask_id <= subtasks_count` for each `task_id`.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the missing subtasks for each `task_id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Tasks table:
+---------+----------------+
| task_id | subtasks_count |
+---------+----------------+
| 1       | 3              |
| 2       | 2              |
| 3       | 4              |
+---------+----------------+

Executed table:
+---------+------------+
| task_id | subtask_id |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 3       | 2          |
| 3       | 3          |
| 3       | 4          |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+---------+------------+
| task_id | subtask_id |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 1          |
| 1       | 3          |
| 2       | 1          |
| 2       | 2          |
+---------+------------+
```

- Task 1 was divided into 3 subtasks `(1, 2, 3)`. Only subtask 2 was executed successfully, so we include `(1, 1)` and `(1, 3)` in the answer.
- Task 2 was divided into 2 subtasks `(1, 2)`. No subtask was executed successfully, so we include `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)` in the answer.
- Task 3 was divided into 4 subtasks `(1, 2, 3, 4)`. All of the subtasks were executed successfully.
