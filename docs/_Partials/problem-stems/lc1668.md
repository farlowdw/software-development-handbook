For a string `sequence`, a string `word` is **`k`-repeating** if `word` concatenated `k` times is a substring of `sequence`. The `word`'s **maximum `k`-repeating value** is the highest value `k` where `word` is `k`-repeating in `sequence`. If `word` is not a substring of `sequence`, `word`'s maximum `k`-repeating value is `0`.

Given strings `sequence` and `word`, return the **maximum `k`-repeating value** of `word` in `sequence`.
