An `N x N` board contains only `0`s and `1`s. In each move, you can swap any `2` rows with each other, or any `2` columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a board where no `0`s and no `1`s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return `-1`.
