You are given a positive integer `n` which is the number of nodes of a **0-indexed undirected weighted connected** graph and a **0-indexed 2D array** `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given two nodes `s` and `d`, and a positive integer `k`, your task is to find the **shortest** path from `s` to `d`, but you can hop over **at most** `k` edges. In other words, make the weight of **at most** `k` edges `0` and then find the **shortest** path from `s` to `d`.

Return the length of the **shortest** path from `s` to `d` with the given condition.
