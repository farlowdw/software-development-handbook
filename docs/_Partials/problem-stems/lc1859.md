A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be **shuffled** by appending the **1-indexed word position** to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

- For example, the sentence `"This is a sentence"` can be shuffled as `"sentence4 a3 is2 This1"` or `"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"`.

Given a **shuffled sentence** `s` containing no more than `9` words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.
