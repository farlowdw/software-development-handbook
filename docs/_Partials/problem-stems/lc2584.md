You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

A **split** at an index `i` where `0 <= i <= n - 2` is called **valid** if the product of the first `i + 1` elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime.

- For example, if `nums = [2, 3, 3]`, then a split at the index `i = 0` is valid because `2` and `9` are coprime, while a split at the index `i = 1` is not valid because `6` and `3` are not coprime. A split at the index `i = 2` is not valid because `i == n - 1`.

Return the smallest index `i` at which the array can be split validly or `-1` if there is no such split.

Two values `val1` and `val2` are coprime if `gcd(val1, val2) == 1` where `gcd(val1, val2)` is the greatest common divisor of `val1` and `val2`.
