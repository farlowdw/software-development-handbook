An **alphabetical continuous string** is a string consisting of consecutive letters in the alphabet. In other words, it is any substring of the string `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`.

- For example, `"abc"` is an alphabetical continuous string, while `"acb"` and `"za"` are not.

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters only, return the length of the **longest** alphabetical continuous substring.
