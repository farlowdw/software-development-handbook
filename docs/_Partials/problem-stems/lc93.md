Given a string `s` containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained from `s`. You can return them in **any order**.

A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers, each integer is between `0` and `255`, separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros. For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are **valid** IP addresses and `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are **invalid** IP addresses.
