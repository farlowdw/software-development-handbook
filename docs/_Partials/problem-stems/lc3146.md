You are given two strings `s` and `t` such that every character occurs at most once in `s` and `t` is a permutation of `s`.

The **permutation difference** between `s` and `t` is defined as the **sum** of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in `s` and the index of the occurrence of the same character in `t`.

Return the **permutation difference** between `s` and `t`.
