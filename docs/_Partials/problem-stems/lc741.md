You are given an `n x n` `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

- `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
- `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
- `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:

- Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value `0` or `1`).
- After reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
- When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell `0`.
- If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then no cherries can be collected.
