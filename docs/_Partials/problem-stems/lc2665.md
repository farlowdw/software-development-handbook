Write a function `createCounter`. It should accept an initial integer `init`. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

- `increment()` increases the current value by `1` and then returns it.
- `decrement()` reduces the current value by `1` and then returns it.
- `reset()` sets the current value to `init` and then returns it.
