You are given a **0-indexed** string `s`. You are also given a **0-indexed** string `queryCharacters` of length `k` and a **0-indexed** array of integer indices queryIndices of length `k`, both of which are used to describe `k` queries.

The `i`th query updates the character in `s` at index `queryIndices[i]` to the character `queryCharacters[i]`.

Return an array lengths of length `k` where `lengths[i]` is the **length** of the **longest substring** of `s` consisting of **only one repeating** character **after** the `i`th query is performed.
