There is a task management system that allows users to manage their tasks, each associated with a priority. The system should efficiently handle adding, modifying, executing, and removing tasks.

Implement the `TaskManager` class:

- `TaskManager(vector<vector<int>>& tasks)` initializes the task manager with a list of user-task-priority triples. Each element in the input list is of the form `[userId, taskId, priority]`, which adds a task to the specified user with the given priority.
- `void add(int userId, int taskId, int priority)` adds a task with the specified `taskId` and `priority` to the user with `userId`. It is **guaranteed** that `taskId` does not *exist* in the system.
- `void edit(int taskId, int newPriority)` updates the priority of the existing `taskId` to `newPriority`. It is **guaranteed** that `taskId` *exists* in the system.
- `void rmv(int taskId)` removes the task identified by `taskId` from the system. It is **guaranteed** that `taskId` *exists* in the system.
- `int execTop()` executes the task with the **highest** priority across all users. If there are multiple tasks with the same **highest** priority, execute the one with the highest `taskId`. After executing, the `taskId` is **removed** from the system. Return the `userId` associated with the executed task. If no tasks are available, return `-1`.

Note that a user may be assigned multiple tasks.
