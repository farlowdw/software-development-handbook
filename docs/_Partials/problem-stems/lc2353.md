Design a food rating system that can do the following:

- **Modify** the rating of a food item listed in the system.
- Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.

Implement the `FoodRatings` class:

- `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)` Initializes the system. The food items are described by `foods`, `cuisines` and `ratings`, all of which have a length of `n`.
  + `foods[i]` is the name of the `i`th food,
  + `cuisines[i]` is the type of cuisine of the `i`th food, and
  + `ratings[i]` is the initial rating of the `i`th food.
- `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)` Changes the rating of the food item with the name `food`.
- `String highestRated(String cuisine)` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of `cuisine`. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.
