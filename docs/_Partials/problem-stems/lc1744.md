You are given a **(0-indexed)** array of positive integers `candiesCount` where `candiesCount[i]` represents the number of candies of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> type you have. You are also given a 2D array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [favoriteType<sub>i</sub>, favoriteDay<sub>i</sub>, dailyCap<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

You play a game with the following rules:

- You start eating candies on day `0`.
- You **cannot** eat **any** candy of type `i` unless you have eaten **all** candies of type `i - 1`.
- You must eat **at least one** candy per day until you have eaten all the candies.

Construct a boolean array `answer` such that `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[i]` is `true` if you can eat a candy of type <code>favoriteType<sub>i</sub></code> on day <code>favoriteDayi<sub>i</sub></code> without eating **more than** <code>dailyCapi<sub>i</sub></code> candies on **any** day, and `false` otherwise. Note that you can eat different types of candy on the same day, provided that you follow rule 2.

Return *the constructed array* `answer`.
