You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in an **undirected** graph. The nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **bidirectional** edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. **Notice** that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into `m` groups (**1-indexed**) such that:

- Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
- For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge <code>[a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>, if <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> belongs to the group with index `x`, and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> belongs to the group with index `y`, then `|y - x| = 1`.

Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum `m`) into which you can divide the nodes. Return `-1` if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.
