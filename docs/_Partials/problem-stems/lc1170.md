Let the function `f(s)` be the **frequency of the lexicographically smallest character** in a non-empty string `s`. For example, if `s = "dcce"` then `f(s) = 2` because the lexicographically smallest character is `'c'`, which has a frequency of `2`.

You are given an array of strings `words` and another array of query strings `queries`. For each query `queries[i]`, count the **number of words** in `words` such that `f(queries[i]) < f(W)` for each `W` in `words`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where each `answer[i]` is the answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query.
