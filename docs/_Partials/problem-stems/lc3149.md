You are given an array `nums` which is a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]`. The **score** of any permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]` named `perm` is defined as:

```
score(perm) = |perm[0] - nums[perm[1]]| + |perm[1] - nums[perm[2]]| + ... + |perm[n - 1] - nums[perm[0]]|
```

Return the permutation `perm` which has the **minimum** possible score. If multiple permutations exist with this score, return the one that is lexicographically smallest among them.
