Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array edges where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
