You are given an array `nums` of non-negative integers. `nums` is considered **special** if there exists a number `x` such that there are **exactly** `x` numbers in nums that are **greater than or equal to** `x`.

Notice that `x` **does not** have to be an element in `nums`.

Return `x` if the array is **special**, otherwise, return `-1`. It can be proven that if `nums` is special, the value for `x` is **unique**.
