```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Scores;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 
  Scores (id int, score DECIMAL(3,2));

INSERT INTO 
  Scores (id, score)
VALUES 
  ('1', '3.5'),
  ('2', '3.65'),
  ('3', '4.0'),
  ('4', '3.85'),
  ('5', '4.0'),
  ('6', '3.65');

**Table:** `Scores`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the score of a game. `score` is a floating point value with two decimal places.

Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by `score` in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

- **Input:** 

```
Scores table:
+----+-------+
| id | score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+-------+------+
| score | rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

:::caution `rank` is a keyword in MySQL

For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword (e.g., `'rank'`).
