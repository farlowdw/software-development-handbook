A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position `x`. Help them get there from position `0`.

The bug jumps according to the following rules:

- It can jump exactly `a` positions **forward** (to the right).
- It can jump exactly `b` positions **backward** (to the left).
- It cannot jump backward twice in a row.
- It cannot jump to any `forbidden` positions.

The bug may jump forward **beyond** its home, but it **cannot jump** to positions numbered with **negative** integers.

Given an array of integers `forbidden`, where `forbidden[i]` means that the bug cannot jump to the position `forbidden[i]`, and integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, return the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position x, return `-1`.
