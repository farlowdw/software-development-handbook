`S` and `T` are strings composed of lowercase letters. In `S`, no letter occurs more than once.

`S` was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of `T` so that they match the order that `S` was sorted. More specifically, if `x` occurs before `y` in `S`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the returned string.

Return any permutation of `T` (as a string) that satisfies this property.
