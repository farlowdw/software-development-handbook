You are maintaining a project that has `n` methods numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given two integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D integer array `invocations`, where <code>invocations[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that method <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> invokes method <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

There is a known bug in method `k`. Method `k`, along with any method invoked by it, either **directly** or **indirectly**, are considered **suspicious** and we aim to remove them.

A group of methods can only be removed if no method **outside** the group invokes any methods **within** it.

Return an array containing all the remaining methods after removing all the **suspicious** methods. You may return the answer in any order. If it is not possible to remove **all** the suspicious methods, **none** should be removed.
