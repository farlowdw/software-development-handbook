There are `n` flights that are labeled from `1` to `n`.

You are given an array of flight bookings `bookings`, where <code>bookings[i] = [first<sub>i</sub>, last<sub>i</sub>, seats<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a booking for flights <code>first<sub>i</sub></code> through <code>last<sub>i</sub></code> (**inclusive**) with <code>seats<sub>i</sub></code> seats reserved for **each flight** in the range.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the total number of seats reserved for flight `i`.
