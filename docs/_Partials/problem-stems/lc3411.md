You are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

An array `arr` is called **product equivalent** if `prod(arr) == lcm(arr) * gcd(arr)`, where:

- `prod(arr)` is the product of all elements of `arr`.
- `gcd(arr)` is the GCD of all elements of arr.
- `lcm(arr)` is the LCM of all elements of arr.

Return the length of the **longest product equivalent** subarray of `nums`.
