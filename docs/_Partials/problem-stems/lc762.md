Given two integers `L` and `R`, find the count of numbers in the range `[L, R]` (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of `1`s present when written in binary. For example, `21` written in binary is `10101` which has `3` set bits. Also, `1` is not a prime.)
