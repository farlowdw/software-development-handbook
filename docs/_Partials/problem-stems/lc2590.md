Design a Todo List Where users can add **tasks**, mark them as **complete**, or get a list of pending tasks. Users can also add **tags** to tasks and can filter the tasks by certain tags.

Implement the `TodoList` class:

- `TodoList()` Initializes the object.
- `int addTask(int userId, String taskDescription, int dueDate, List<String> tags)` Adds a task for the user with the ID `userId` with a due date equal to `dueDate` and a list of tags attached to the task. The return value is the ID of the task. This ID starts at `1` and is **sequentially** increasing. That is, the first task's id should be `1`, the second task's id should be `2`, and so on.
- `List<String> getAllTasks(int userId)` Returns a list of all the tasks not marked as complete for the user with ID `userId`, ordered by the due date. You should return an empty list if the user has no uncompleted tasks.
- `List<String> getTasksForTag(int userId, String tag)` Returns a list of all the tasks that are not marked as complete for the user with the ID `userId` and have `tag` as one of their tags, ordered by their due date. Return an empty list if no such task exists.
- `void completeTask(int userId, int taskId)` Marks the task with the ID `taskId` as completed only if the task exists and the user with the ID `userId` has this task, and it is uncompleted.
