You are given an **even** number of people `num_people` that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else, so that there are `num_people / 2` handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since this number could be very big, return the answer **mod** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>
