You are given a binary array `nums` containing only the integers `0` and `1`. Return the number of **subarrays** in nums that have **more** `1`'s than `0`'s. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
