You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `i`th bag. You are also given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute **all** the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The **unfairness** of a distribution is defined as the **maximum total** cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return the **minimum** unfairness of all distributions.
