You are given an array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given a `queries` array, <code>where queries[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, m<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query is the maximum bitwise `XOR` value of <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and any element of nums that does not exceed <code>m<sub>i</sub></code>. In other words, the answer is <code>max(nums[j] XOR x<sub>i</sub>)</code> for all `j` such that <code>nums[j] <= m<sub>i</sub></code>. If all elements in `nums` are larger than <code>m<sub>i</sub></code>, then the answer is `-1`.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[i]` is the answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query.
