You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.

The **gcd-sum** of an array `a` is calculated as follows:

- Let `s` be the sum of all the elements of `a`.
- Let `g` be the **greatest common divisor** of all the elements of `a`.
- The gcd-sum of `a` is equal to `s * g`.

Return the **maximum gcd-sum** of a subarray of `nums` with at least `k` elements.
