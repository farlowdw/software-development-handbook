A city is represented as a **bi-directional connected** graph with `n` vertices where each vertex is labeled from `1` to `n` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and vertex <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is `time` minutes.

Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from **green** to **red** and vice versa every `change` minutes. All signals change **at the same time**. You can enter a vertex at **any time**, but can leave a vertex **only when the signal is green**. You **cannot wait** at a vertex if the signal is **green**.

The **second minimum value** is defined as the smallest value **strictly larger** than the minimum value.

- For example the second minimum value of `[2, 3, 4]` is `3`, and the second minimum value of `[2, 2, 4]` is `4`.

Given `n`, `edges`, `time`, and `change`, return the **second minimum time** it will take to go from vertex `1` to vertex `n`.

**Notes:**

- You can go through any vertex **any** number of times, **including** `1` and `n`.
- You can assume that when the journey **starts**, all signals have just turned **green**.
