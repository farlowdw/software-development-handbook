There is an `m x n` grid, where `(0, 0)` is the top-left cell and `(m - 1, n - 1)` is the bottom-right cell. You are given an integer array `startPos` where <code>startPos = [start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>]</code> indicates that **initially**, a **robot** is at the cell <code>(start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>)</code>. You are also given an integer array `homePos` where <code>homePos = [home<sub>row</sub>, home<sub>col</sub>]</code> indicates that its **home** is at the cell <code>(home<sub>row</sub>, home<sub>col</sub>)</code>.

The robot needs to go to its home. It can move one cell in four directions: **left**, **right**, **up**, or **down**, and it can not move outside the boundary. Every move incurs some cost. You are further given two **0-indexed** integer arrays: `rowCosts` of length `m` and `colCosts` of length `n`.

- If the robot moves **up** or **down** into a cell whose **row** is `r`, then this move costs `rowCosts[r]`.
- If the robot moves **left** or **right** into a cell whose **column** is `c`, then this move costs `colCosts[c]`.

Return the **minimum total cost** for this robot to return home.
