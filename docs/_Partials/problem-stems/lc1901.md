A **peak** element in a 2D grid is an element that is **strictly greater** than all of its **adjacent** neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `mat` where **no two adjacent cells are equal**, find **any** peak element `mat[i][j]` and return the length 2 array `[i,j]`.

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an **outer perimeter** with the value `-1` in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.
