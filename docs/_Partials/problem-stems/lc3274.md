You are given two strings, `coordinate1` and `coordinate2`, representing the coordinates of a square on an `8 x 8` chessboard.

Below is the chessboard for reference.

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/3274-f1.png').default} />
</div>

Return `true` if these two squares have the same color and `false` otherwise.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first (indicating its column), and the number second (indicating its row).
