You are given a **0-indexed** string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the `i`th block. The characters `'W'` and `'B'` denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of **consecutive** black blocks.

In one operation, you can **recolor** a white block such that it becomes a black block.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed such that there is at least **one** occurrence of `k` consecutive black blocks.
