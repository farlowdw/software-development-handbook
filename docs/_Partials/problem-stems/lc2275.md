The **bitwise AND** of an array `nums` is the bitwise AND of all integers in `nums`.

- For example, for `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, the bitwise AND is equal to `1 & 5 & 3 = 1`.
- Also, for `nums = [7]`, the bitwise AND is `7`.

You are given an array of positive integers `candidates`. Evaluate the **bitwise AND** of every **combination** of numbers of `candidates`. Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in each combination.

Return the size of the **largest** combination of `candidates` with a bitwise AND **greater** than `0`.
