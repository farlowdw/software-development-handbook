You are given a **0-indexed** array of `n` integers `arr`.

The **interval** between two elements in `arr` is defined as the **absolute difference** between their indices. More formally, the **interval** between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is `|i - j|`.

Return an array `intervals` of length `n` where `intervals[i]` is **the sum of intervals** between `arr[i]` and each element in `arr` with the same value as `arr[i]`.

**Note:** `|x|` is the absolute value of `x`.
