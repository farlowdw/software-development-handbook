A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array `buildings`, where <code>buildings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, height<sub>i</sub>]</code>. This means that there is a building with <code>height<sub>i</sub></code> in the half-closed segment <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>.

You want to **describe** the heights of the buildings on the street with the **minimum** number of non-overlapping **segments**. The street can be represented by the 2D integer array `street` where <code>street[j] = [left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>, average<sub>j</sub>]</code> describes a **half-closed segment** <code>[left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>)</code> of the road where the **average** heights of the buildings in the **segment** is <code>average<sub>j</sub></code>.

- For example, if buildings = `[[1,5,2],[3,10,4]]`, the street could be represented by `street = [[1,3,2],[3,5,3],[5,10,4]]` because:
  + From `1` to `3`, there is only the first building with an average height of `2 / 1 = 2`.
  + From `3` to `5`, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of `(2+4) / 2 = 3`.
  + From `5` to `10`, there is only the second building with an average height of `4 / 1 = 4`.

Given `buildings`, return the 2D integer array `street` as described above (**excluding** any areas of the street where there are no buldings). You may return the array in **any order**.

The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided (**integer division**) by `n`.

A **half-closed segment** `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points `a` and `b` **including** point `a` and **not including** point `b`.
