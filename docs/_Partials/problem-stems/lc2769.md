You are given two integers, `num` and `t`.

An integer `x` is called **achievable** if it can become equal to `num` after applying the following operation no more than `t` times:

- Increase or decrease `x` by `1`, and simultaneously increase or decrease `num` by `1`.

Return the maximum possible achievable number. It can be proven that there exists at least one achievable number.
