You are given an integer array `nums` and a **positive** integer `k`. You can choose any **subsequence** of the array and sum all of its elements together.

We define the **K-Sum** of the array as the `k`th **largest** subsequence sum that can be obtained (**not** necessarily distinct).

Return the K-Sum of the array.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Note** that the empty subsequence is considered to have a sum of `0`.
