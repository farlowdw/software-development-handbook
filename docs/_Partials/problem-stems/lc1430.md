Given a binary tree where each path going from the root to any leaf form a **valid sequence**, check if a given string is a **valid sequence** in such binary tree. 

We get the given string from the concatenation of an array of integers arr and the concatenation of all values of the nodes along a path results in a **sequence** in the given binary tree.
