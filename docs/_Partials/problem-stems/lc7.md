Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range <code>[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]</code>, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**
