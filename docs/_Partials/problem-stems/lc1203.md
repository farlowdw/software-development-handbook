There are `n` items each belonging to zero or one of `m` groups where `group[i]` is the group that the `i`th item belongs to and it's equal to `-1` if the `i`th item belongs to no group. The items and the groups are zero indexed. A group can have no item belonging to it.

Return a sorted list of the items such that:

- The items that belong to the same group are next to each other in the sorted list.
- There are some relations between these items where `beforeItems[i]` is a list containing all the items that should come before the `i`th item in the sorted array (to the left of the `i`th item).

Return any solution if there is more than one solution and return an **empty list** if there is no solution.
