You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

You are also given an integer array `queries` of size `m`. For the `i`th query, you want to make all of the elements of `nums` equal to `queries[i]`. You can perform the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- **Increase** or **decrease** an element of the array by `1`.

Return an array `answer` of size `m` where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of `nums` equal to `queries[i]`.

**Note** that after each query the array is reset to its original state.
