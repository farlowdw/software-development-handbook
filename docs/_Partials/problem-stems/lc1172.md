You have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and numbered (left to right) from `0`, each of the stacks has the same maximum `capacity`.

Implement the `DinnerPlates` class:

- `DinnerPlates(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the maximum `capacity` of the stacks.
- `void push(int val)` Pushes the given positive integer `val` into the leftmost stack with size less than capacity.
- `int pop()` Returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack, and returns `-1` if all stacks are empty.
- `int popAtStack(int index)` Returns the value at the top of the stack with the given `index` and removes it from that stack, and returns `-1` if the stack with that given `index` is empty.
