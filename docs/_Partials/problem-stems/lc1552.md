In universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the `i`th basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return the required force.
