You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. The XOR of a segment `[left, right]` where `left <= right` is the `XOR` of all the elements with indices between `left` and `right`, inclusive: `nums[left] XOR nums[left+1] XOR ... XOR nums[right]`.

Return the minimum number of elements to change in the array such that the `XOR` of all segments of size `k` is equal to zero.
