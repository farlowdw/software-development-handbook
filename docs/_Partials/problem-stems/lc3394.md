You are given an integer `n` representing the dimensions of an `n x n` grid, with the origin at the bottom-left corner of the grid. You are also given a 2D array of coordinates `rectangles`, where `rectangles[i]` is in the form <code>[start<sub>x</sub>, start<sub>y</sub>, end<sub>x</sub>, end<sub>y</sub>]</code>, representing a rectangle on the grid. Each rectangle is defined as follows:

- <code>(start<sub>x</sub>, start<sub>y</sub>)</code>: The bottom-left corner of the rectangle.
- <code>(end<sub>x</sub>, end<sub>y</sub>)</code>: The top-right corner of the rectangle.

**Note** that the rectangles do not overlap. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make **either two horizontal** or **two vertical cuts** on the grid such that:

- Each of the three resulting sections formed by the cuts contains **at least** one rectangle.
- Every rectangle belongs to **exactly** one section.

Return `true` if such cuts can be made; otherwise, return `false`.
