You have a pointer at index `0` in an array of size `arrLen`. At each step, you can move `1` position to the left, `1` position to the right in the array or stay in the same place  (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any time).

Given two integers `steps` and `arrLen`, return the number of ways such that your pointer still at index `0` after **exactly** `steps` steps.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
