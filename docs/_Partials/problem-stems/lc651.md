Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

- `Key 1: (A)`:Print one `'A'` on screen.
- `Key 2: (Ctrl-A)`: Select the whole screen.
- `Key 3: (Ctrl-C)`: Copy selection to buffer.
- `Key 4: (Ctrl-V)`: Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.

Now, you can only press the keyboard for `N` times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of `'A'` you can print on screen.
