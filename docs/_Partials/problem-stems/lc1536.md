Given an `n x n` binary `grid`, in one step you can choose two **adjacent rows** of the grid and swap them.

A grid is said to be **valid** if all the cells above the main diagonal are **zeros**.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid, or `-1` if the grid cannot be valid.

The main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell `(1, 1)` and ends at cell `(n, n)`.
