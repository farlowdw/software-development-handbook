**Table:** `TeamPoints`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| team_id     | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| points      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `team_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the ID of a national team, the name of the country it represents, and the points it has in the global rankings. No two teams will represent the same country.

**Table:** `PointsChange`

```
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| team_id       | int  |
| points_change | int  |
+---------------+------+
```

- `team_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the ID of a national team and the change in its points in the global rankings.
points_change can be:
  + **0**: indicates no change in points.
  + **positive**: indicates an increase in points.
  + **negative**: indicates a decrease in points.
- Each `team_id` that appears in `TeamPoints` will also appear in this table.

The **global ranking** of a national team is its rank after sorting all the teams by their points i**n descending order**. If two teams have the same points, we break the tie by sorting them by their name **in lexicographical order**.

The points of each national team should be updated based on its corresponding `points_change` value.

Write an SQL query to calculate the change in the global rankings after updating each team's points.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
