You are given a **0-indexed** matrix `grid` of order `n * n`. Each cell in this matrix has a value `grid[i][j]`, which is either a **positive** integer or `-1` representing a blocked cell.

You can move from a non-blocked cell to any non-blocked cell that shares an edge.

For any cell `(i, j)`, we represent its **remoteness** as `R[i][j]` which is defined as the following:

- If the cell `(i, j)` is a **non-blocked** cell, `R[i][j]` is the sum of the values `grid[x][y]` such that there is **no path** from the **non-blocked** cell `(x, y)` to the cell `(i, j)`.
- For blocked cells, `R[i][j] == 0`.

Return the sum of `R[i][j]` over all cells.
