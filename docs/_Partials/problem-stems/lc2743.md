You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters. We call a substring **special** if it contains no character which has occurred at least twice (in other words, it does not contain a repeating character). Your task is to count the number of **special** substrings. For example, in the string `"pop"`, the substring `"po"` is a special substring, however, `"pop"` is not special (since `'p'` has occurred twice).

Return the number of **special** substrings.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, `"abc"` is a substring of `"abcd"`, but `"acd"` is not.
