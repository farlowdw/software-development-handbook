Given two integers representing the `numerator` and `denominator` of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

If multiple answers are possible, return **any of them**.

It is **guaranteed** that the length of the answer string is less than <code>10<sup>4</sup></code> for all the given inputs.
