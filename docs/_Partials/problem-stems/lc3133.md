You are given two integers `n` and `x`. You have to construct an array of **positive** integers `nums` of size `n` where for every `0 <= i < n - 1`, `nums[i + 1]` is **greater than** `nums[i]`, and the result of the bitwise `AND` operation between all elements of `nums` is `x`.

Return the **minimum** possible value of `nums[n - 1]`.
