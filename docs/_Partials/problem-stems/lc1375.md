You have a **1-indexed** binary string of length `n` where all the bits are `0` initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. You are given a **1-indexed** integer array `flips` where `flips[i]` indicates that the bit at index `i` will be flipped in the `i`th step.

A binary string is **prefix-aligned** if, after the `i`th step, all the bits in the **inclusive** range `[1, i]` are ones and all the other bits are zeros.

Return the number of times the binary string is **prefix-aligned** during the flipping process.
