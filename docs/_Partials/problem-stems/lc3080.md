You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of size `n` consisting of positive integers.

You are also given a 2D array `queries` of size `m` where <code>queries[i] = [index<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

Initially all elements of the array are **unmarked**.

You need to apply `m` queries on the array in order, where on the `i`th query you do the following:

- Mark the element at index <code>index<sub>i</sub></code> if it is not already marked.
- Then mark <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> unmarked elements in the array with the **smallest** values. If multiple such elements exist, mark the ones with the smallest indices. And if less than <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> unmarked elements exist, then mark all of them.

Return an array `answer` of size `m` where `answer[i]` is the **sum** of unmarked elements in the array after the `i`th query.
