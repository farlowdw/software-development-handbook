You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You have to partition the array into one or more **contiguous** subarrays.

We call a partition of the array **valid** if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies **one** of the following conditions:

1. The subarray consists of **exactly** `2` equal elements. For example, the subarray `[2,2]` is good.
2. The subarray consists of **exactly** `3` equal elements. For example, the subarray `[4,4,4]` is good.
3. The subarray consists of **exactly** `3` consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between adjacent elements is `1`. For example, the subarray `[3,4,5]` is good, but the subarray `[1,3,5]` is not.

Return `true` if the array has **at least** one valid partition. Otherwise, return `false`.
