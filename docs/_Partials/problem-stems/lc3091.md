You are given a **positive** integer `k`. Initially, you have an array `nums = [1]`.

You can perform **any** of the following operations on the array **any** number of times (**possibly zero**):

- Choose any element in the array and **increase** its value by `1`.
- Duplicate any element in the array and add it to the end of the array.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make the **sum** of elements of the final array greater than or equal to `k`.
