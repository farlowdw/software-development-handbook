You are given all the nodes of an [N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/introduction-to-n-ary-trees/) as an array of `Node` objects, where each node has a **unique value**.

Return the **root** of the N-ary tree.

**Custom testing:**

An N-ary tree can be serialized as represented in its level order traversal where each group of children is separated by the `null` value (see examples).

For example, the above tree is serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.

The testing will be done in the following way:

1. The **input data** should be provided as a serialization of the tree.
2. The driver code will construct the tree from the serialized input data and put each `Node` object into an array **in an arbitrary order**.
3. The driver code will pass the array to `findRoot`, and your function should find and return the root `Node` object in the array.
4. The driver code will take the returned `Node` object and serialize it. If the serialized value and the input data are the **same**, the test **passes**.
