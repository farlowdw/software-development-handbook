You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m`, respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the `i`th spell and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the `j`th potion.

You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered **successful** if the **product** of their strengths is **at least** `success`.

Return an integer array `pairs` of length `n` where `pairs[i]` is the number of **potions** that will form a successful pair with the `i`th spell.
