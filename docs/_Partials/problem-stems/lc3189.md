Given a 2D array `rooks` of length `n`, where <code>rooks[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates the position of a rook on an `n x n` chess board. Your task is to move the rooks **1 cell** at a time vertically or horizontally (to an adjacent cell) such that the board becomes **peaceful**.

A board is **peaceful** if there is **exactly** one rook in each row and each column.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required to get a peaceful board.

**Note** that **at no point** can there be two rooks in the same cell.
