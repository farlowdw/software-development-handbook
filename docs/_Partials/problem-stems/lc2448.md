You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `nums` and `cost` consisting each of `n` **positive** integers.

You can do the following operation **any** number of times:

- Increase or decrease **any** element of the array `nums` by `1`.

The cost of doing one operation on the `i`th element is `cost[i]`.

Return the **minimum** total cost such that all the elements of the array `nums` become **equal**.
