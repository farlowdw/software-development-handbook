There are `n` engineers numbered from `1` to `n` and two arrays: `speed` and `efficiency`, where `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and efficiency for the `i`th engineer respectively. Return the maximum **performance** of a team composed of at most `k` engineers, since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

The **performance** of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.
