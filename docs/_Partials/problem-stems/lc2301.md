You are given two strings `s` and `sub`. You are also given a 2D character array `mappings` where <code>mappings[i] = [old<sub>i</sub>, new<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you may **replace** any number of <code>old<sub>i</sub></code> characters of `sub` with <code>new<sub>i</sub></code>. Each character in `sub` **cannot** be replaced more than once.

Return `true` if it is possible to make `sub` a substring of `s` by replacing zero or more characters according to `mappings`. Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
