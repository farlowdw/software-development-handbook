Design a special dictionary which has some words and allows you to search the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.

Implement the `WordFilter` class:

- `WordFilter(string[] words)` Initializes the object with the `words` in the dictionary.
- `f(string prefix, string suffix)` Returns the index of the word in the dictionary which has the prefix `prefix` and the suffix `suffix`. If there is more than one valid index, return **the largest** of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return `-1`.
