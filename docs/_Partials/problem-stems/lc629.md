Given two integers `n` and `k`, find how many different arrays consist of numbers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs.

We define an inverse pair as following: For <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> element in the array, if `i < j` and `a[i] > a[j]` then it's an inverse pair; otherwise, it's not.

Since the answer may be very large, the answer should be modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
