You are given an integer array `nums`. A **good** subsequence is defined as a subsequence of `nums` where the absolute difference between any **two** consecutive elements in the subsequence is **exactly** `1`.

Return the **sum** of all possible **good subsequences** of `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that a subsequence of size `1` is considered good by definition.
