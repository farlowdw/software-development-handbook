You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

We call a subarray of an array **complete** if the following condition is satisfied:

- The number of **distinct** elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.

Return the number of **complete** subarrays.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.
