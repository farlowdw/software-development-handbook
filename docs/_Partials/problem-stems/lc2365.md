You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `tasks`, representing tasks that need to be completed **in order**, where `tasks[i]` represents the **type** of the `i`th task.

You are also given a positive integer `space`, which represents the **minimum** number of days that must pass **after** the completion of a task before another task of the **same** type can be performed.

Each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:

- Complete the next task from `tasks`, or
- Take a break.

Return the **minimum** number of days needed to complete all tasks.
