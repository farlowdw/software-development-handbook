Given the array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays from the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of `n * (n + 1) / 2` numbers.

Return the sum of the numbers from index `left` to index `right` (**indexed from 1**), inclusive, in the new array. Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
