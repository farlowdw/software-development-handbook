Given a string `s`, you need to partition it into one or more **balanced** substrings. For example, if `s == "ababcc"` then `("abab", "c", "c")`, `("ab", "abc", "c")`, and `("ababcc")` are all valid partitions, but <code>("a", <strong>"bab"</strong>>, "cc")</code>, <code>(<strong>"aba"</strong>>, "bc", "c")</code>, and <code>("ab", <strong>"abcc"</strong>>)</code> are not. The unbalanced substrings are bolded.

Return the **minimum** number of substrings that you can partition `s` into.

**Note:** A **balanced** string is a string where each character in the string occurs the same number of times.
