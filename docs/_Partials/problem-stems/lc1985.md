You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in `nums` represents an integer without leading zeros.

Return the string that represents the `k`th **largest integer** in `nums`.

**Note:** Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if `nums` is `["1","2","2"]`, `"2"` is the first largest integer, `"2"` is the second-largest integer, and `"1"` is the third-largest integer.
