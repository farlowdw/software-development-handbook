You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each <code>people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> with exactly <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h<sub>i</sub></code>.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where <code>queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>]</code> is the attributes of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).
