You are given a string `word` of size `n`, and an integer `k` such that `k` divides `n`.

In one operation, you can pick any two indices `i` and `j`, that are divisible by `k`, then replace the substring of length `k` starting at `i` with the substring of length `k` starting at `j`. That is, replace the substring word`[i..i + k - 1]` with the substring `word[j..j + k - 1]`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `word` **k-periodic**.

We say that `word` is **k-periodic** if there is some string `s` of length `k` such that `word` can be obtained by concatenating `s` an arbitrary number of times. For example, if `word == "ababab"`, then `word` is 2-periodic for `s = "ab"`.
