You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return `true` if the starting player can **guarantee a win**, and `false` otherwise.
