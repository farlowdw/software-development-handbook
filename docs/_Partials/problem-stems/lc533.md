Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer N, find the number of black pixels located at some specific row `R` and column `C` that align with all the following rules:

1. Row `R` and column `C` both contain exactly `N` black pixels.
2. For all rows that have a black pixel at column `C`, they should be exactly the same as row `R`.

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of `'B'` and `'W'`, which means black and white pixels respectively.
