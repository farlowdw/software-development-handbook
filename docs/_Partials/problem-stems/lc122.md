Say you have an array `prices` for which the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
