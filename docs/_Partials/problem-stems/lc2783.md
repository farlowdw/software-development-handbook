**Table:** `Flights`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| flight_id   | int  |
| capacity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `flight_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains flight id and its capacity.

**Table:** `Passengers`

```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| flight_id    | int  |
+--------------+------+
```

- `passenger_id` is the primary key column for this table.
- Each row of this table contains passenger id and flight id.

Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a passenger books a ticket for a flight and there are still empty seats available on the flight, the passenger ticket will be **confirmed**. However, the passenger will be on a **waitlist** if the flight is already at full capacity.

Write an SQL query to report the number of passengers who successfully booked a flight (got a seat) and the number of passengers who are on the waitlist for each flight.

Return the result table ordered by `flight_id` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
