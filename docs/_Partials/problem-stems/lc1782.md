You are given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n`, which is the number of nodes, and `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> which indicates that there is an undirected edge between <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer array `queries`.

The answer to the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query is the number of pairs of nodes `(a, b)` that satisfy the following conditions:

- `a < b`
- `cnt` is **strictly greater** than `queries[j]`, where `cnt` is the number of edges incident to `a` **or** `b`.

Return an array `answers` such that `answers.length == queries.length` and `answers[j]` is the answer of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query.

Note that there can be **repeated edges**.
