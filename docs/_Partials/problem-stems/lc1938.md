There is a rooted tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. Each node's number denotes its **unique genetic** value (i.e. the genetic value of node `x` is `x`). The **genetic difference** between two genetic values is defined as the **bitwise-XOR** of their values. You are given the integer array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent for node `i`. If node `x` is the **root** of the tree, then `parents[x] == -1`.

You are also given the array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [node<sub>i</sub>, val<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query `i`, find the **maximum genetic difference** between <code>val<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>p<sub>i</sub></code>, where <code>p<sub>i</sub></code> is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between <code>node<sub>i</sub></code> and the root (including nodei and the root). More formally, you want to maximize <code>val<sub>i</sub> XOR p<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.
