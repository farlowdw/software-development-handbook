You are given a string `s`, a string `chars` of **distinct** characters and an integer array `vals` of the same length as `chars`.

The **cost of the substring** is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered `0`.

The **value of the character** is defined in the following way:

- If the character is not in the string `chars`, then its value is its corresponding position (**1-indexed**) in the alphabet.
  + For example, the value of `'a'` is `1`, the value of `'b'` is `2`, and so on. The value of `'z'` is `26`.
- Otherwise, assuming `i` is the index where the character occurs in the string `chars`, then its value is `vals[i]`.

Return the maximum cost among all substrings of the string `s`.
