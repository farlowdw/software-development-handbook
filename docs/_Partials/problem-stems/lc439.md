Given a string representing arbitrarily nested ternary expressions, calculate the result of the expression. You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only consists of digits `0-9`, `?`, `:`, `T` and `F` (`T` and `F` represent True and False respectively).

**Note:**

1. The length of the given string is â‰¤ 10000.
2. Each number will contain only one digit.
3. The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages).
4. The condition will always be either T or F. That is, the condition will never be a digit.
5. The result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit 0-9, T or F.
