You are given an integer `mountainHeight` denoting the height of a mountain.

You are also given an integer array `workerTimes` representing the work time of workers in **seconds**.

The workers work **simultaneously** to **reduce** the height of the mountain. For worker `i`:

- To decrease the mountain's height by `x`, it takes `workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x` seconds. For example:
  + To reduce the height of the mountain by `1`, it takes `workerTimes[i]` seconds.
  + To reduce the height of the mountain by `2`, it takes `workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2` seconds, and so on.

Return an integer representing the **minimum** number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain `0`.
