You are given two positive integer arrays `nums` and `target`, of the same length.

In one operation, you can choose any two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` where `0 <= i, j < nums.length` and:

- set `nums[i] = nums[i] + 2` and
- set `nums[j] = nums[j] - 2`.

Two arrays are considered to be **similar** if the frequency of each element is the same.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `nums` similar to `target`. The test cases are generated such that `nums` can always be similar to `target`.
