Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.

Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are `1` and itself, and it is greater than `1`. 

For example, `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11` and `13` are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 

For example, `12321` is a palindrome.
