A **good meal** is a meal that contains **exactly two different food items** with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick **any** two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the <code>i​​<sup>th</sup></code> item of food, return the number of different **good meals** you can make from this list modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.
