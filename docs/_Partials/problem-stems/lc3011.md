You are given a **0-indexed** array of **positive** integers `nums`.

In one **operation**, you can swap any two **adjacent** elements if they have the **same** number of set bits. You are allowed to do this operation **any** number of times (**including zero**).

Return `true` if you can sort the array, else return `false`.
