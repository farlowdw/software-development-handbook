There exists an undirected tree rooted at node `0` with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D **integer** array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given a **0-indexed** array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` indicates the number of coins in the vertex `i`, and an integer `k`.

Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.

Coins at <code>node<sub>i</sub></code> can be collected in one of the following ways:

- Collect all the coins, but you will get `coins[i] - k` points. If `coins[i] - k` is negative then you will lose `abs(coins[i] - k)` points.
- Collect all the coins, but you will get `floor(coins[i] / 2)` points. If this way is used, then for all the <code>node<sub>j</sub></code> present in the subtree of <code>node<sub>i</sub></code>, `coins[j]` will get reduced to `floor(coins[j] / 2)`.

Return the **maximum points** you can get after collecting the coins from **all** the tree nodes.
