You are given a binary string `s`.

You can perform the following operation on the string any number of times:

- Choose any index `i` from the string where `i + 1 < s.length` such that `s[i] == '1'` and `s[i + 1] == '0'`.
- Move the character `s[i]` to the right until it reaches the end of the string or another `'1'`. For example, for `s = "010010"`, if we choose `i = 1`, the resulting string will be `s = "000110"`.

Return the **maximum** number of operations that you can perform.
