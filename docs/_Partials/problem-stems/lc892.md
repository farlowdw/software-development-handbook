You are given an `n x n` `grid` where you have placed some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes. Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of cell `(i, j)`.

After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.

Return the total surface area of the resulting shapes.

**Note:** The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.
