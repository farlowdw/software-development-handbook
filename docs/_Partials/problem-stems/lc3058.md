**Table:** `Friends`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id1    | int  |
| user_id2    | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `(user_id1, user_id2)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
- Each row contains user id1, user id2, both of whom are friends with each other.

Write a solution to find **all pairs** of users who are friends with each other and have **no mutual** friends.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id1`, `user_id2` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

- **Input:** 

```
Friends table:
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 | 
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        | 
| 2        | 3        | 
| 2        | 4        | 
| 1        | 5        | 
| 6        | 7        | 
| 3        | 4        | 
| 2        | 5        | 
| 8        | 9        | 
+----------+----------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 | 
+----------+----------+
| 6        | 7        | 
| 8        | 9        | 
+----------+----------+
```

- **Explanation:** 
  + Users `1` and `2` are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID `5`, so this pair is not included.
  + Users `2` and `3` are friends, they both share a mutual friend with user ID `4`, resulting in exclusion, similarly for users `2` and `4` who share a mutual friend with user ID `3`, hence not included.
  + Users `1` and `5` are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID `2`, so this pair is not included.
  + Users `6` and `7`, as well as users `8` and `9`, are friends with each other, and they don't have any mutual friends, hence included.
  + Users `3` and `4` are friends with each other, but their mutual connection with user ID `2` means they are not included, similarly for users 2 and 5 are friends but are excluded due to their mutual connection with user ID `1`.

  Output table is ordered by `user_id1` in ascending order.
