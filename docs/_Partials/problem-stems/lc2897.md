You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a **positive** integer `k`.

You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose any two distinct indices `i` and `j` and **simultaneously** update the values of `nums[i]` to `(nums[i] AND nums[j])` and `nums[j]` to `(nums[i] OR nums[j])`. Here, `OR` denotes the bitwise `OR` operation, and `AND` denotes the bitwise `AND` operation.

You have to choose `k` elements from the final array and calculate the sum of their **squares**.

Return the **maximum** sum of squares you can achieve.

Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
