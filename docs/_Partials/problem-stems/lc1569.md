Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of `nums` in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder nums so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.

For example, given `nums = [2,1,3]`, we will have `2` as the root, `1` as a left child, and `3` as a right child. The array `[2,3,1]` also yields the same BST but `[3,2,1]` yields a different BST.

Return the number of ways to reorder `nums` such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
