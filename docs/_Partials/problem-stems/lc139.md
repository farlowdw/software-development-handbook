Given a **non-empty** string `s` and a dictionary `wordDict` containing a list of non-empty words, determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note:**

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
