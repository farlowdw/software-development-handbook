There are `n` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in **left to right** order. You are given an array `heights` of **distinct** integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i`th person.

A person can **see** another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is **shorter** than both of them. More formally, the `i`th person can see the `j`th person if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the **number of people** the `i`th person can **see** to their right in the queue.
