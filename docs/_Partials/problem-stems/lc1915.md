A **wonderful** string is a string where **at most one** letter appears an **odd** number of times.

- For example, `"ccjjc"` and `"abab"` are wonderful, but `"ab"` is not.

Given a string `word` that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters (`'a'` through `'j'`), return the **number of wonderful non-empty substrings** in `word`. If the same substring appears multiple times in `word`, then count **each occurrence** separately.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
