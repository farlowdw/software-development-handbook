There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up**, **down**, **left** or **right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls onto the hole.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's position `ball` and the hole's position `hole`, where <code>ball = [ball<sub>row</sub>, ball<sub>col</sub>]</code> and <code>hole = [hole<sub>row</sub>, hole<sub>col</sub>]</code>, return a string `instructions` of all the instructions that the ball should follow to drop in the hole with the **shortest distance** possible. If there are multiple valid instructions, return the **lexicographically minimum** one. If the ball can't drop in the hole, return `"impossible"`.

If there is a way for the ball to drop in the hole, the answer `instructions` should contain the characters `'u'` (i.e., up), `'d'` (i.e., down), `'l'` (i.e., left), and `'r'` (i.e., right).

The **distance** is the number of **empty spaces** traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).
