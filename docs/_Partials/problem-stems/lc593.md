Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space `p1`, `p2`, `p3` and `p4`, return `true` if the four points construct a square.

The coordinate of a point <code>p<sub>i</sub></code> is represented as <code>[x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The input is **not** given in any order.

A **valid square** has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
