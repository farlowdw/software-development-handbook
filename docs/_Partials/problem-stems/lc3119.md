You are given a string `road`, consisting only of characters `"x"` and `"."`, where each `"x"` denotes a pothole and each `"."` denotes a smooth road, and an integer `budget`.

In one repair operation, you can repair `n` **consecutive** potholes for a price of `n + 1`.

Return the **maximum** number of potholes that can be fixed such that the sum of the prices of all of the fixes **doesn't go over** the given budget.
