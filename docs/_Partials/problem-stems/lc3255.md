You are given an array of integers `nums` of length `n` and a positive integer `k`.

The **power** of an array is defined as:

- Its **maximum** element if all of its elements are **consecutive** and **sorted** in **ascending** order.
- `-1` otherwise.

You need to find the **power** of all subarrays of `nums` of size `k`.

Return an integer array `results` of size `n - k + 1`, where `results[i]` is the power of `nums[i..(i + k - 1)]`.
