Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.

You can split string `s` into any list of **non-empty substrings**, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
