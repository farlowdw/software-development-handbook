Given an array of strings `words` and a string `s`, determine if `s` is an **acronym** of words.

The string `s` is considered an acronym of `words` if it can be formed by concatenating the **first** character of each string in `words` in order. For example, `"ab"` can be formed from `["apple", "banana"]`, but it can't be formed from `["bear", "aardvark"]`.

Return `true` if `s` is an acronym of `words`, and `false` otherwise.
