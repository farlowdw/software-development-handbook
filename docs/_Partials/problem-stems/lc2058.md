A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return an array of length `2` containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]` where `minDistance` is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and `maxDistance` is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.
