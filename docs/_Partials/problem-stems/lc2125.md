Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a **0-indexed** binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an `m x n` 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the `i`th row, consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while `'1'` means the cell has a security device.

There is **one** laser beam between any **two** security devices **if both** conditions are met:

- The two devices are located on two **different rows**: <code>r<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>r<sub>2</sub></code>, where <code>r<sub>1</sub> < r<sub>2</sub></code>.
- For **each** row `i` where <code>r<sub>1</sub> < i < r<sub>2</sub></code>, there are **no security devices** in the `i`th row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.
