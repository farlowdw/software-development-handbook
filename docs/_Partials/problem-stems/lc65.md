A **valid number** can be split up into these components (in order):

1. A **decimal number** or an **integer**.
2. (Optional) An `'e'` or `'E'`, followed by an integer.

A **decimal number** can be split up into these components (in order):

1. (Optional) A sign character (either `'+'` or `'-'`).
2. One of the following formats:
  1. At least one digit, followed by a dot `'.'`.
  2. At least one digit, followed by a dot `'.'`, followed by at least one digit.
  3. A dot `'.'`, followed by at least one digit.

An **integer** can be split up into these components (in order):

1. (Optional) A sign character (either `'+'` or `'-'`).
2. At least one digit.

For example, all the following are valid numbers: `["2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7", "+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789"]`, while the following are not valid numbers: `["abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53"]`.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if `s` is a valid number.
