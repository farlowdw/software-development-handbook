There is a `50 x 50` chessboard with **one** knight and some pawns on it. You are given two integers `kx` and `ky` where `(kx, ky)` denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array `positions` where <code>positions[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.

Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:

- The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the **fewest** possible **moves**. **Note** that the player can select **any** pawn, it **might not** be one that can be captured in the **least** number of moves.
- In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight **may** pass other pawns **without** capturing them. **Only** the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

Alice is trying to **maximize** the **sum** of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to **minimize** them.

Return the **maximum** total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play **optimally**.

Note that in one **move**, a chess knight has eight possible positions it can move to, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.
