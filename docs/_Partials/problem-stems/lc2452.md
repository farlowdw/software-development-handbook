You are given two string arrays, `queries` and `dictionary`. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.

In one **edit** you can take a word from `queries`, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from `queries` that, after a **maximum** of two edits, equal some word from `dictionary`.

Return a list of all words from `queries`, that match with some word from `dictionary` after a maximum of **two edits**. Return the words in the **same order** they appear in `queries`.
