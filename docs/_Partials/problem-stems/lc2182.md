You are given a string `s` and an integer `repeatLimit`. Construct a new string `repeatLimitedString` using the characters of `s` such that no letter appears **more than** `repeatLimit` times **in a row**. You do **not** have to use all characters from `s`.

Return the **lexicographically largest** `repeatLimitedString` possible.

A string `a` is **lexicographically larger** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.
