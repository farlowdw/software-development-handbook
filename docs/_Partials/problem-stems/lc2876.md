There is a **directed** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n` directed edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** array `edges` where `edges[i]` indicates that there is an edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

Consider the following process on the graph:

- You start from a node `x` and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this **same** process.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the number of **different** nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node `i`.
