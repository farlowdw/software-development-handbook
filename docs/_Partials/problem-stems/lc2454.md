You are given a **0-indexed** array of non-negative integers `nums`. For each integer in `nums`, you must find its respective **second greater** integer.

The **second greater** integer of `nums[i]` is `nums[j]` such that:

- `j > i`
- `nums[j] > nums[i]`
- There exists **exactly one** index `k` such that `nums[k] > nums[i]` and `i < k < j`.

If there is no such `nums[j]`, the second greater integer is considered to be `-1`.

- For example, in the array `[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the second greater integer of `1` is `4`, `2` is `3`, and that of `3` and `4` is `-1`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the second greater integer of `nums[i]`.
