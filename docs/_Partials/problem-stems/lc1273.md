A tree rooted at node `0` is given as follows:

- The number of nodes is `nodes`;
- The value of the `i`th node is `value[i]`;
- The parent of the `i`th node is `parent[i]`.

Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.
