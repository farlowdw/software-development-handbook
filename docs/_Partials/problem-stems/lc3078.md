You are given a 2D integer matrix `board` and a 2D character matrix `pattern`. Where `0 <= board[r][c] <= 9` and each element of `pattern` is either a digit or a lowercase English letter.

Your task is to find a submatrix of `board` that **matches** `pattern`.

An integer matrix `part` matches `pattern` if we can replace cells containing letters in `pattern` with some digits (each **distinct** letter with a **unique** digit) in such a way that the resulting matrix becomes identical to the integer matrix `part`. In other words,

- The matrices have identical dimensions.
- If `pattern[r][c]` is a digit, then `part[r][c]` must be the same digit.
- If `pattern[r][c]` is a letter `x`:
  + For every `pattern[i][j] == x`, `part[i][j]` must be the **same** as `part[r][c]`.
  + For every `pattern[i][j] != x`, `part[i][j]` must be **different** than `part[r][c]`.

Return an array of length `2` containing the row number and column number of the upper-left corner of a submatrix of `board` which matches `pattern`. If there is more than one such submatrix, return the coordinates of the submatrix with the lowest row index, and in case there is still a tie, return the coordinates of the submatrix with the lowest column index. If there are no suitable answers, return `[-1, -1]`.
