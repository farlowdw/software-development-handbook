You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. In one **operation**, you can change the value of **any** cell to **any** non-negative number. You need to perform some **operations** such that each cell `grid[i][j]` is:

- Equal to the cell below it, i.e. `grid[i][j] == grid[i + 1][j]` (if it exists).
- Different from the cell to its right, i.e. `grid[i][j] != grid[i][j + 1]` (if it exists).

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed.
