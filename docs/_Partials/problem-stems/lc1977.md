You wrote down many **positive** integers in a string called `num`. However, you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers. You remember that the list of integers was **non-decreasing** and that **no** integer had leading zeros.

Return the **number of possible lists of integers** that you could have written down to get the string `num`. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
