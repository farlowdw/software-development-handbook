You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You can rearrange the elements of `nums` to **any order** (including the given order).

Let `prefix` be the array containing the prefix sums of `nums` after rearranging it. In other words, `prefix[i]` is the sum of the elements from `0` to `i` in `nums` after rearranging it. The **score** of `nums` is the number of positive integers in the array `prefix`.

Return the maximum score you can achieve.
