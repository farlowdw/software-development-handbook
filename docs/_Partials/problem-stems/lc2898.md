Given a **1-indexed** integer array `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the price of a particular stock on the `i`th day, your task is to select some of the elements of `prices` such that your selection is **linear**.

A selection `indexes`, where `indexes` is a **1-indexed** integer array of length `k` which is a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, is **linear** if:

- For every `1 < j <= k`, `prices[indexes[j]] - prices[indexes[j - 1]] == indexes[j] - indexes[j - 1]`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The **score** of a selection `indexes`, is equal to the sum of the following array: `[prices[indexes[1]], prices[indexes[2]], ..., prices[indexes[k]]`.

Return the **maximum score** that a linear selection can have.
