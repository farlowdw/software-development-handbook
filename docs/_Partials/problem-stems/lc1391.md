Given a `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of the `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:

- **1** which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
- **2** which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
- **3** which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
- **4** which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
- **5** which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
- **6** which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. **The path should only follow the streets.**

**Notice** that you are **not allowed** to change any street.

Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.
