Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps. Each **unique** message should only be printed **at most every 10 seconds** (i.e. a message printed at timestamp `t` will prevent other identical messages from being printed until timestamp `t + 10`).

All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

Implement the `Logger` class:

- `Logger()` Initializes the `logger` object.
- `bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message)` Returns `true` if the `message` should be printed in the given `timestamp`, otherwise returns `false`.
