A dieter consumes `calories[i]` calories on the `i`th day. 

Given an integer `k`, for **every** consecutive sequence of `k` days (`calories[i], calories[i+1], ..., calories[i+k-1]` for all `0 <= i <= n-k`), they look at `T`, the total calories consumed during that sequence of `k` days (`calories[i] + calories[i+1] + ... + calories[i+k-1]`):

- If `T < lower`, they performed poorly on their diet and lose 1 point; 
- If `T > upper`, they performed well on their diet and gain 1 point;
- Otherwise, they performed normally and there is no change in points.

Initially, the dieter has zero points. Return the total number of points the dieter has after dieting for `calories.length` days.

Note that the total points can be negative.
