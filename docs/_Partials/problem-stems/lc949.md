Given an array `arr` of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit **exactly once**.

24-hour times are formatted as `"HH:MM"`, where `HH` is between `00` and `23`, and `MM` is between `00` and `59`. The earliest 24-hour time is `00:00`, and the latest is `23:59`.

Return the latest 24-hour time in `"HH:MM"` format.  If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.
