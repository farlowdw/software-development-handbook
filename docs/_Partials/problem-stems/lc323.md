You have a graph of `n` nodes. You are given an integer `n` and an array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.
