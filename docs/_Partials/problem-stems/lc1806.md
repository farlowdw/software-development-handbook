You are given an **even** integer `n`. You initially have a permutation `perm` of size `n` where `perm[i] == i` **(0-indexed)**.

In one operation, you will create a new array `arr`, and for each `i`:

- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
- If `i % 2 == 1`, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.

You will then assign `arr` to `perm`.

Return the minimum **non-zero** number of operations you need to perform on `perm` to return the permutation to its initial value.
