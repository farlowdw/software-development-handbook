Given an integer array `nums`, find the **maximum** possible **bitwise OR** of a subset of `nums` and return the **number of different non-empty subsets** with the maximum bitwise OR.

An array `a` is a **subset** of an array `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of `b`. Two subsets are considered **different** if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

The bitwise OR of an array `a` is equal to `a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1]` (**0-indexed**).
