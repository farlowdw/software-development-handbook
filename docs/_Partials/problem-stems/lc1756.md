Design a queue-like data structure that moves the most recently used element to the end of the queue.

Implement the `MRUQueue` class:

- `MRUQueue(int n)` constructs the `MRUQueue` with `n` elements: `[1,2,3,...,n]`.
- `fetch(int k)` moves the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> element **(1-indexed)** to the end of the queue and returns it.
