Design a data structure that keeps track of the values in it and answers some queries regarding their mean, median, and mode.

Implement the `StatisticsTracker` class.

- `StatisticsTracker()`: Initialize the `StatisticsTracker` object with an empty array.
- `void addNumber(int number)`: Add `number` to the data structure.
- `void removeFirstAddedNumber()`: Remove the earliest added number from the data structure.
- `int getMean()`: Return the floored **mean** of the numbers in the data structure.
- `int getMedian()`: Return the **median** of the numbers in the data structure.
- `int getMode()`: Return the **mode** of the numbers in the data structure. If there are multiple modes, return the smallest one.

**Note:**

- The **mean** of an array is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values in the array.
- The **median** of an array is the middle element of the array when it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If there are two choices for a median, the larger of the two values is taken.
- The **mode** of an array is the element that appears most often in the array.
