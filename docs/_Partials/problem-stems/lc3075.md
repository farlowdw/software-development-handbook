You are given an array `happiness` of length `n`, and a **positive** integer `k`.

There are `n` children standing in a queue, where the `i`th child has **happiness value** `happiness[i]`. You want to select `k` children from these `n` children in `k` turns.

In each turn, when you select a child, the **happiness value** of all the children that have **not** been selected till now decreases by `1`. Note that the happiness value **cannot** become negative and gets decremented **only** if it is positive.

Return the **maximum** sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by selecting `k` children.
