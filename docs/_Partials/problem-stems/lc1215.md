A Stepping Number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly `1`. For example, `321` is a Stepping Number while `421` is not.

Given two integers `low` and `high`, find and return a **sorted** list of all the Stepping Numbers in the range `[low, high]` inclusive.
