You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

Return the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in the array exactly**. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

- `"a->b"` if `a != b`
- `"a"` if `a == b`
