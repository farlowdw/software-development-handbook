Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.  If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

(A string `S` is a subsequence of string `T` if deleting some number of characters from `T` (possibly `0`, and the characters are chosen <u>anywhere</u> from `T`) results in the string `S`.)
