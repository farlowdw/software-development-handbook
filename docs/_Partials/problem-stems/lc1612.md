A [binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators. In this problem, we only consider the `'+'` operator (i.e. addition).

You are given the roots of two binary expression trees, `root1` and `root2`. Return `true` if the two binary expression trees are equivalent. Otherwise, return `false`.

Two binary expression trees are equivalent if they **evaluate to the same value** regardless of what the variables are set to.

**Follow up:** What will you change in your solution if the tree also supports the `'-'` operator (i.e. subtraction)?
