You are given an array `words` of size `n` consisting of **non-empty** strings.

We define the **score** of a string `word` as the **number** of strings `words[i]` such that `word` is a **prefix** of `words[i]`.

For example, if `words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"]`, then the score of `"ab"` is `2`, since `"ab"` is a prefix of both `"ab"` and `"abc"`.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **sum** of scores of every **non-empty** prefix of `words[i]`.

**Note** that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.
