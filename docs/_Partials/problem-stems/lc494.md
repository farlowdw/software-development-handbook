You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an **expression** out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

- For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.
