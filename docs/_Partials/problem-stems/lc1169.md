A transaction is possibly invalid if:

- the amount exceeds `$1000`, or;
- if it occurs within (and including) `60` minutes of another transaction with the **same name** in a **different city**.

You are given an array of strings `transaction` where `transactions[i]` consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Return a list of `transactions` that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in **any order**.
