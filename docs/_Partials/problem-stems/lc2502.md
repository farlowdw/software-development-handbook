You are given an integer `n` representing the size of a **0-indexed** memory array. All memory units are initially free.

You have a memory allocator with the following functionalities:

1. **Allocate** a block of `size` consecutive free memory units and assign it the id `mID`.
2. **Free** all memory units with the given id `mID`.

**Note** that:

- Multiple blocks can be allocated to the same `mID`.
- You should free all the memory units with `mID`, even if they were allocated in different blocks.

Implement the Allocator class:

- `Allocator(int n)` Initializes an `Allocator` object with a memory array of size `n`.
- `int allocate(int size, int mID)` Find the **leftmost** block of `size` **consecutive** free memory units and allocate it with the id `mID`. Return the block's first index. If such a block does not exist, return `-1`.
- `int free(int mID)` Free all memory units with the id `mID`. Return the number of memory units you have freed.
