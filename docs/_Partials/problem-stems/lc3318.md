You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and two integers `k` and `x`.

The **x-sum** of an array is calculated by the following procedure:

- Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
- Keep only the occurrences of the top `x` most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the **bigger** value is considered more frequent.
- Calculate the sum of the resulting array.

**Note** that if an array has less than `x` distinct elements, its **x-sum** is the sum of the array.

Return an integer array `answer` of length `n - k + 1` where `answer[i]` is the **x-sum** of the subarray `nums[i..i + k - 1]`.
