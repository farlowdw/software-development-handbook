You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.

A string `x` is called **almost equal** to `y` if you can change **at most** one character in `x` to make it identical to `y`.

A sequence of indices `seq` is called **valid** if:

- The indices are sorted in **ascending** order.
- Concatenating the characters at these indices in `word1` in **the same** order results in a string that is **almost equal** to `word2`.

Return an array of size `word2.length` representing the lexicographically smallest **valid** sequence of indices. If no such sequence of indices exists, return an **empty** array.

**Note** that the answer must represent the lexicographically smallest array, **not** the corresponding string formed by those indices.
