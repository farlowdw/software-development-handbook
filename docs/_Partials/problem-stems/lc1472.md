You have a **browser** of one tab where you start on the `homepage` and you can visit another `url`, get back in the history number of `steps` or move forward in the history number of `steps`.

Implement the BrowserHistory class:

- `BrowserHistory(string homepage)` Initializes the object with the `homepage` of the browser.
- `void visit(string url)` Visits `url` from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
- `string back(int steps)` Move `steps` back in history. If you can only return `x` steps in the history and `steps > x`, you will return only `x` steps. Return the current `url` after moving back in history **at most** `steps`.
- `string forward(int steps)` Move `steps` forward in history. If you can only forward `x` steps in the history and `steps > x`, you will forward only `x` steps. Return the current `url` after forwarding in history **at most** `steps`.
