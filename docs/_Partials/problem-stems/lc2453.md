You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive integers, representing targets on a number line. You are also given an integer `space`.

You have a machine which can destroy targets. **Seeding** the machine with some `nums[i]` allows it to destroy all targets with values that can be represented as `nums[i] + c * space`, where `c` is any non-negative integer. You want to destroy the **maximum** number of targets in `nums`.

Return the **minimum value** of `nums[i]` you can seed the machine with to destroy the maximum number of targets.
