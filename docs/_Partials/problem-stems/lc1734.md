There is an integer array `perm` that is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is always **odd**.

It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]`. For example, if `perm = [1,3,2]`, then `encoded = [2,1]`.

Given the `encoded` array, return the original array `perm`. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.
