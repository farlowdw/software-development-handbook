You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `coins`, representing the values of the coins available, and an integer `target`.

An integer `x` is **obtainable** if there exists a subsequence of `coins` that sums to `x`.

Return the **minimum** number of coins **of any value** that need to be added to the array so that every integer in the range `[1, target]` is **obtainable**.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new **non-empty** array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (**possibly none**) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.
