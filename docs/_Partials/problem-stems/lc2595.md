You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` (**0-indexed**) with value `1`.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` (**0-indexed**) with value `1`.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer = [even, odd]`.
