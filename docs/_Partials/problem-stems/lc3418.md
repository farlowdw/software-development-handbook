You are given an `m x n` grid. A robot starts at the top-left corner of the grid `(0, 0)` and wants to reach the bottom-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`. The robot can move either right or down at any point in time.

The grid contains a value `coins[i][j]` in each cell:

- If `coins[i][j] >= 0`, the robot gains that many coins.
- If `coins[i][j] < 0`, the robot encounters a robber, and the robber steals the absolute value of `coins[i][j]` coins.

The robot has a special ability to **neutralize robbers** in at most **2 cells** on its path, preventing them from stealing coins in those cells.

**Note:** The robot's total coins can be negative.

Return the maximum profit the robot can gain on the route.
