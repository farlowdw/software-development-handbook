Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of `0`'s and `1`'s, an **island** is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of **distinct** islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected) to equal the other.
