Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is **more than one**, they will do the following:

1. Choose an integer `x > 1`, and **remove** the leftmost `x` stones from the row.
2. Add the **sum** of the **removed** stones' values to the player's score.
3. Place a **new stone**, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when **only one** stone is left in the row.

The **score difference** between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's score)`. Alice's goal is to **maximize** the score difference, and Bob's goal is the **minimize** the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `i`th stone **from the left**, return the **score difference** between Alice and Bob if they both play **optimally**.
