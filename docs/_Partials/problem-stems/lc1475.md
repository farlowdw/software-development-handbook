Given the array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `i`th item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the **minimum** index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the `i`th element is the final price you will pay for the `i`th item of the shop considering the special discount.
