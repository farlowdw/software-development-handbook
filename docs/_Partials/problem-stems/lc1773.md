You are given an array `items`, where each <code>items[i] = [type<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>, name<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes the type, color, and name of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item is said to match the rule if **one** of the following is true:

- <code>ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == type<sub>i</sub></code>
- <code>ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == color<sub>i</sub></code>
- <code>ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == name<sub>i</sub></code>

Return the number of items that match the given rule.
