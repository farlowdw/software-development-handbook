Consider the string `s` to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so `s` will look like this: "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".

Now we have another string `p`. Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of `p` are present in `s`. In particular, your input is the string `p` and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of `p` in the string `s`.

**Note:** `p` consists of only lowercase English letters and the size of p might be over 10000.
