You are given a **0-indexed** binary matrix `grid`. In one operation, you can flip any `1` in `grid` to be `0`.

A binary matrix is **well-isolated** if there is no `1` in the matrix that is **4-directionally connected** (i.e., horizontal and vertical) to another `1`.

Return the minimum number of operations to make `grid` **well-isolated**.
