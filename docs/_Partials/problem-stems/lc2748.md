You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of indices `i`, `j` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` is called beautiful if the **first digit** of `nums[i]` and the **last digit** of `nums[j]` are **coprime**.

Return the total number of beautiful pairs in `nums`.

Two integers `x` and `y` are **coprime** if there is no integer greater than `1` that divides both of them. In other words, `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
