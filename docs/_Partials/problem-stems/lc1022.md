You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

Return the sum of these numbers. The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bits** integer.
