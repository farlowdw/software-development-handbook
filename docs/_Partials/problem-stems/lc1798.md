You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the `n` coins that you own. The value of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> coin is `coins[i]`. You can **make** some value `x` if you can choose some of your `n` coins such that their values sum up to `x`.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you **can make** with your coins **starting** from and **including** `0`.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.
