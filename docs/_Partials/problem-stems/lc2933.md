You are given a 2D **0-indexed** array of strings, `access_times`, with size `n`. For each `i` where `0 <= i <= n - 1`, `access_times[i][0]` represents the name of an employee, and `access_times[i][1]` represents the access time of that employee. All entries in `access_times` are within the same day.

The access time is represented as **four digits** using a **24-hour** time format, for example, `"0800"` or `"2250"`.

An employee is said to be **high-access** if he has accessed the system **three or more** times within a **one-hour period**.

Times with exactly one hour of difference are **not** considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, `"0815"` and `"0915"` are not part of the same one-hour period.

Access times at the start and end of the day are **not** counted within the same one-hour period. For example, `"0005"` and `"2350"` are not part of the same one-hour period.

Return a list that contains the names of **high-access** employees with any order you want.
