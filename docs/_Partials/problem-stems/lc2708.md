You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the score of students in an exam. The teacher would like to form one **non-empty** group of students with maximal **strength**, where the strength of a group of students of indices <code>i<sub>0</sub>, i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, ... , i<sub>k</sub></code> is defined as <code>nums[i<sub>0</sub>] * nums[i<sub>1</sub>] * nums[i<sub>2</sub>] * ... * nums[i<sub>k</sub>â€‹]</code>.

Return the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create.
