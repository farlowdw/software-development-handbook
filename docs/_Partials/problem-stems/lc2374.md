You are given a directed graph with n nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **exactly one** outgoing edge.

The graph is represented by a given **0-indexed** integer array `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a **directed** edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

The **edge score** of a node `i` is defined as the sum of the **labels** of all the nodes that have an edge pointing to `i`.

Return the node with the highest **edge score**. If multiple nodes have the same **edge score**, return the node with the **smallest** index.
