In English, we have a concept called **root**, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **successor**. For example, when the **root** `"an"` is followed by the **successor** word `"other"`, we can form a new word `"another"`.

Given a `dictionary` consisting of many **roots** and a `sentence` consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the **successors** in the sentence with the **root** forming it. If a **successor** can be replaced by more than one **root**, replace it with the **root** that has **the shortest length**.

Return the `sentence` after the replacement.
