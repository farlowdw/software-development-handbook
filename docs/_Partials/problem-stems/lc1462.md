There are a total of `n` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have direct prerequisites, for example, to take course `0` you have first to take course `1`, which is expressed as a pair: `[1,0]`

Given the total number of courses `n`, a list of direct `prerequisite` **pairs** and a list of `queries` **pairs**.

You should answer for each `queries[i]` whether the course `queries[i][0]` is a prerequisite of the course `queries[i][1]` or not.

Return a list of boolean, the answers to the given `queries`.

Please note that if course `a` is a prerequisite of course `b` and course `b` is a prerequisite of course `c`, then, course `a` is a prerequisite of course `c`.
