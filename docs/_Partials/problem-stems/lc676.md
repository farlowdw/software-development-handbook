Design a data structure that is initialized with a list of **different** words. Provided a string, you should determine if you can change exactly one character in this string to match any word in the data structure.

Implement the `MagicDictionary` class:

- `MagicDictionary()` Initializes the object.
- `void buildDict(String[] dictionary)` Sets the data structure with an array of distinct strings `dictionary`.
- `bool search(String searchWord)` Returns `true` if you can change **exactly one character** in `searchWord` to match any string in the data structure, otherwise returns `false`.
