There are `n` employees, each with a unique id from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where <code>logs[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, leaveTime<sub>i</sub>]</code> where:

- <code>id<sub>i</sub></code> is the id of the employee that worked on the `i`th task, and
- <code>leaveTime<sub>i</sub></code> is the time at which the employee finished
  the <code>i</code>th task. All the values <code>leaveTime<sub>i</sub></code>
  are <strong>unique</strong>.

Note that the `i`th task starts the moment right after the `(i - 1)`th task ends, and the `0`th task starts at time `0`.

Return the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time. If there is a tie between two or more employees, return the **smallest** id among them.
