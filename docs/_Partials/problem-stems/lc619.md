```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_numbers;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  my_numbers (num int);

INSERT INTO
  my_numbers (num)
VALUES
  ('8'),
  ('8'),
  ('3'),
  ('3'),
  ('1'),
  ('4'),
  ('5'),
  ('6');
```

Table `my_numbers` contains many numbers in column `num` including duplicated ones. Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

```
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
```

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:

```
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
```

**Note:** If there is no such number, just output `null`.
