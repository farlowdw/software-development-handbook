There are an infinite amount of bags on a number line, one bag for each coordinate. Some of these bags contain coins.

You are given a 2D array `coins`, where <code>coins[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that every bag from <code>l<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> contains <code>c<sub>i</sub></code> coins.

The segments that `coins` contain are non-overlapping.

You are also given an integer `k`.

Return the **maximum** amount of coins you can obtain by collecting `k` consecutive bags.
