You are given a **0-indexed** 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`, where `(r, c)` represents:

- A **land** cell if `grid[r][c] = 0`, or
- A **water** cell containing `grid[r][c]` fish, if `grid[r][c] > 0`.

A fisher can start at any **water** cell `(r, c)` and can do the following operations any number of times:

- Catch all the fish at cell `(r, c)`, or
- Move to any adjacent **water** cell.

Return the **maximum** number of fish the fisher can catch if he chooses his starting cell optimally, or `0` if no water cell exists.

An **adjacent** cell of the cell `(r, c)`, is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)` or `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.
