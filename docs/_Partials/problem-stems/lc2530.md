You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You have a **starting score** of `0`.

In one **operation**:

1. choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length`,
2. increase your **score** by `nums[i]`, and
3. replace `nums[i]` with `ceil(nums[i] / 3)`.

Return the maximum possible **score** you can attain after applying **exactly** `k` operations.

The ceiling function `ceil(val)` is the least integer greater than or equal to `val`.
