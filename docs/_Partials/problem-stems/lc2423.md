You are given a **0-indexed** string `word`, consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to select **one** index and **remove** the letter at that index from `word` so that the **frequency** of every letter present in `word` is equal.

Return `true` if it is possible to remove one letter so that the frequency of all letters in `word` are equal, and `false` otherwise.

**Note:**

- The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.
- You **must** remove exactly one letter and cannot chose to do nothing.
