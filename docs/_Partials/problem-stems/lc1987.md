You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `"0"`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

- For example, if `binary = "001"`, then all the **good** subsequences are `["0", "0", "1"]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0"` and `"1"`. Note that subsequences `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"001"` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
