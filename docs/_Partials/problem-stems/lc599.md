Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their **common interest** with the **least list index sum**. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
