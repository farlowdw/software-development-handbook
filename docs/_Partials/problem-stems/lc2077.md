A maze consists of `n` rooms numbered from `1` to `n`, and some rooms are connected by corridors. You are given a 2D integer array `corridors` where <code>corridors[i] = [room1<sub>i</sub>, room2<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a corridor connecting <code>room1<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>room2<sub>i</sub></code>, allowing a person in the maze to go from <code>room1<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>room2<sub>i</sub></code> **and vice versa**.

The designer of the maze wants to know how confusing the maze is. The **confusion score** of the maze is the number of different cycles of **length 3**.

- For example, `1 → 2 → 3 → 1` is a cycle of length `3`, but `1 → 2 → 3 → 4` and `1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 1` are not.

Two cycles are considered to be **different** if one or more of the rooms visited in the first cycle is **not** in the second cycle.

Return the **confusion score** of the maze.
