Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Implement the `MovingAverage` class:

- `MovingAverage(int size)` Initializes the object with the size of the window `size`.
- `double next(int val)` Returns the moving average of the last `size` values of the stream.
