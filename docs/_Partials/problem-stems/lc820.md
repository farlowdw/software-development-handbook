A **valid encoding** of an array of `words` is any reference string `s` and array of indices `indices` such that:

- `words.length == indices.length`
- The reference string `s` ends with the `'#'` character.
- For each index `indices[i]`, the **substring** of `s` starting from `indices[i]` and up to (but not including) the next `'#'` character is equal to `words[i]`.

Given an array of `words`, return the **length of the shortest reference string** `s` possible of any **valid encoding** of `words`.
