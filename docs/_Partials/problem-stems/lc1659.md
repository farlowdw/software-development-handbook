You are given four integers, `m`, `n`, `introvertsCount`, and `extrovertsCount`. You have an `m x n` grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are `introvertsCount` introverts and `extrovertsCount` extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you **do not** have to have all the people living in the grid.

The **happiness** of each person is calculated as follows:

- Introverts **start** with `120` happiness and **lose** `30` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
- Extroverts **start** with `40` happiness and **gain** `20` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The **grid happiness** is the **sum** of each person's happiness. Return the **maximum possible grid happiness**.
