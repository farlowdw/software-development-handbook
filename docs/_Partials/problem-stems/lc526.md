Suppose you have `n` integers labeled `1` through `n`. A permutation of those `n` integers `perm` (**1-indexed**) is considered a **beautiful arrangement** if for every `i` (`1 <= i <= n`), **either** of the following is true:

- `perm[i]` is divisible by `i`.
- `i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.

Given an integer `n`, return the **number** of the **beautiful arrangements** that you can construct.
