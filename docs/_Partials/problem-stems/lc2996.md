You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums`.

A prefix `nums[0..i]` is **sequential** if, for all `1 <= j <= i`, `nums[j] = nums[j - 1] + 1`. In particular, the prefix consisting only of `nums[0]` is **sequential**.

Return the **smallest** integer `x` missing from `nums` such that `x` is greater than or equal to the sum of the **longest** sequential prefix.
