You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `peaks` where <code>peaks[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> states that mountain `i` has a peak at coordinates <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code>. A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles triangle, with its base along the x-axis and a right angle at its peak. More formally, the **gradients** of ascending and descending the mountain are `1` and `-1` respectively.

A mountain is considered **visible** if its peak does not lie within another mountain (including the border of other mountains).

Return the number of visible mountains.
