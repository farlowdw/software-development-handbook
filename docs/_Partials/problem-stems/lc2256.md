You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The **average difference** of the index `i` is the **absolute difference** between the average of the **first** `i + 1` elements of `nums` and the average of the **last** `n - i - 1` elements. Both averages should be **rounded down** to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the **minimum average difference**. If there are multiple such indices, return the **smallest** one.

**Note:**

- The **absolute difference** of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
- The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided (**integer division**) by `n`.
- The average of `0` elements is considered to be `0`.
