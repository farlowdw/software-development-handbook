We are given a matrix with `R` rows and `C` columns has cells with integer coordinates `(r, c)`, where `0 <= r < R` and `0 <= c < C`.

Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates `(r0, c0)`.

Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from `(r0, c0)` from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is the Manhattan distance, `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.  (You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.)
