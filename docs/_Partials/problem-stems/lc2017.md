You are given a **0-indexed** 2D array `grid` of size `2 x n`, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position `(r, c)` on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at `(0, 0)` and want to reach `(1, n-1)`. Each robot may only move to the **right** (`(r, c)` to `(r, c + 1)`) or **down** (`(r, c)` to `(r + 1, c)`).

At the start of the game, the **first** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells `(r, c)` traversed on the path, `grid[r][c]` is set to `0`. Then, the **second** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The **first** robot wants to **minimize** the number of points collected by the **second** robot. In contrast, the **second** robot wants to **maximize** the number of points it collects. If both robots play **optimally**, return the **number of points** collected by the **second** robot.
