You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `flowers`, where <code>flowers[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> means the `i`th flower will be in full bloom from <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> (**inclusive**). You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `persons` of size `n`, where `persons[i]` is the time that the `i`th person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return an integer array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **number** of flowers that are in full bloom when the `i`th person arrives.
