You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, you can choose integer `i` in the range `[0, 60]` and subtract `2i + num2` from `num1`.

Return the integer denoting the **minimum** number of operations needed to make `num1` equal to `0`.

If it is impossible to make `num1` equal to `0`, return `-1`.
