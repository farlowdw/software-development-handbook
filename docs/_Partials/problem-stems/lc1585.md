Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to transform string `s` into string `t` using the following operation any number of times:

- Choose a **non-empty** substring in `s` and sort it in-place so the characters are in **ascending order**.

For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in <code>"1<u>4234</u>"</code> results in <code>"1<u>2344</u>"</code>.

Return `true` if it is possible to transform string `s` into string `t`. Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
