You are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` consisting of positive integers.

You have to replace **all** the `0`'s in both arrays with **strictly** positive integers such that the sum of elements of both arrays becomes **equal**.

Return the **minimum** equal sum you can obtain, or `-1` if it is impossible.
