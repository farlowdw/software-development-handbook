There is a dungeon with `n x m` rooms arranged as a grid.

You are given a 2D array `moveTime` of size `n x m`, where `moveTime[i][j]` represents the **minimum** time in seconds when you can **start moving** to that room. You start from the room `(0, 0)` at time `t = 0` and can move to an **adjacent** room. Moving between **adjacent** rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, **alternating** between the two.

Return the **minimum** time to reach the room `(n - 1, m - 1)`.

Two rooms are **adjacent** if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.
