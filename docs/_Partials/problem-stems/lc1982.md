You are given an integer `n` representing the length of an unknown array that you are trying to recover. You are also given an array `sums` containing the values of all <code>2<sup>n</sup></code> **subset sums** of the unknown array (in no particular order).

Return the array `ans` of length `n` representing the unknown array. If **multiple** answers exist, return **any** of them.

An array `sub` is a **subset** of an array `arr` if `sub` can be obtained from `arr` by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of `arr`. The sum of the elements in `sub` is one possible **subset sum** of `arr`. The sum of an empty array is considered to be `0`.

**Note:** Test cases are generated such that there will **always** be at least one correct answer.
