Given two strings `a` and `b`, return `true` if you can swap two letters in `a` so the result is equal to `b`, otherwise, return `false`.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.
