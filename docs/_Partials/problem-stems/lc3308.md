Uber is analyzing drivers based on their trips. Write a solution to find the **top-performing driver** for **each fuel type** based on the following criteria:

1. A driver's performance is calculated as the **average rating** across all their trips. Average rating should be rounded to `2` decimal places.
2. If two drivers have the same average rating, the driver with the **longer total distance** traveled should be ranked higher.
3. If there is **still a tie**, choose the driver with the **fewest accidents**.

Return the result table ordered by `fuel_type` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

```
Drivers table:
+-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
| driver_id | name     | age | experience | accidents |
+-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
| 1         | Alice    | 34  | 10         | 1         |
| 2         | Bob      | 45  | 20         | 3         |
| 3         | Charlie  | 28  | 5          | 0         |
+-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+

Vehicles table:
+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
| vehicle_id | driver_id | model   | fuel_type | mileage |
+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
| 100        | 1         | Sedan   | Gasoline  | 20000   |
| 101        | 2         | SUV     | Electric  | 30000   |

+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+

Trips table:
+---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
| trip_id | vehicle_id | distance | duration | rating |
+---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
| 201     | 100        | 50       | 30       | 5      |
| 202     | 100        | 30       | 20       | 4      |
| 203     | 101        | 100      | 60       | 4      |
| 204     | 101        | 80       | 50       | 5      |
| 205     | 102        | 40       | 30       | 5      |

+---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
| fuel_type | driver_id | rating | distance |
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
| Electric  | 2         | 4.50   | 180      |
| Gasoline  | 3         | 5.00   | 100      |
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
```

- **Explanation:** 

- For fuel type `Gasoline`, both Alice (Driver 1) and Charlie (Driver 3) have trips. Charlie has an average rating of 5.0, while Alice has 4.5. Therefore, Charlie is selected.
- For fuel type `Electric`, Bob (Driver 2) is the only driver with an average rating of 4.5, so he is selected.

The output table is ordered by `fuel_type` in ascending order.
