You are given a binary string `binary` consisting of only `0`'s or `1`'s. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:

- Operation 1: If the number contains the substring `"00"`, you can replace it with `"10"`.
  + For example, <code>"<u>00</u>010" -> "<u>10</u>010"</code>
- Operation 2: If the number contains the substring `"10"`, you can replace it with `"01"`.
  + For example, <code>"000<u>10</u>" -> "000<u>01</u>"</code>

Return the **maximum binary string** you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string `x` is greater than binary string `y` if `x`'s decimal representation is greater than `y`'s decimal representation.
