You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in `s` appears **exactly twice**. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `distance` of length `26`.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from `0` to `25` (i.e. `'a' -> 0`, `'b' -> 1`, `'c' -> 2`, `...` , `'z' -> 25`).

In a **well-spaced** string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the `i`th letter is `distance[i]`. If the `i`th letter does not appear in `s`, then `distance[i]` can be **ignored**.

Return `true` if `s` is a **well-spaced** string, otherwise return `false`.
