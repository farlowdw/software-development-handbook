**Table:** `Employees`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is `employee_id`.

**Table:** `Salaries`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is `employee_id`.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with **missing information**. The information of an employee is missing if:

- The employee's **name** is missing, or
- The employee's **salary** is missing.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id` **in ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Employees table:
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
+-------------+----------+

Salaries table:
+-------------+--------+
| employee_id | salary |
+-------------+--------+
| 5           | 76071  |
| 1           | 22517  |
| 4           | 63539  |
+-------------+--------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 2           |
+-------------+
```

- Employees `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5` are working at this company.
- The name of employee `1` is missing.
- The salary of employee `2` is missing.
