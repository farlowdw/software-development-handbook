You are given a positive integer `n` representing n cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads`, where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, cost<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with a cost of traveling equal to <code>cost<sub>i</sub></code>.

You can buy apples in **any** city you want, but some cities have different costs to buy apples. You are given the array `appleCost` where `appleCost[i]` is the cost of buying one apple from city `i`.

You start at some city, traverse through various roads, and eventually buy **exactly** one apple from **any** city. After you buy that apple, you have to return back to the city you **started** at, but now the cost of all the roads will be **multiplied** by a given factor `k`.

Given the integer `k`, return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** total cost to buy an apple if you start at city `i`.
