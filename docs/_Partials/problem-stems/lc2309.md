Given a string of English letters `s`, return the **greatest** English letter which occurs as **both** a lowercase and uppercase letter in `s`. The returned letter should be in **uppercase**. If no such letter exists, return an empty string.

An English letter `b` is **greater** than another letter `a` if `b` appears **after** `a` in the English alphabet.
