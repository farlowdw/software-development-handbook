You are given an integer `eventTime` denoting the duration of an event, where the event occurs from time `t = 0` to time `t = eventTime`.

You are also given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime`, each of length `n`. These represent the start and end time of `n` non-overlapping meetings, where the `i`th meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.

You can reschedule **at most** `k` meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the **same duration**, to **maximize** the longest continuous period of free time during the event.

The **relative** order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping.

Return the **maximum** amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event.
