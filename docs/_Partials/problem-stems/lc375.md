We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

1. I pick a number between `1` and `n`.
2. You guess a number.
3. If you guess the right number, **you win the game**.
4. If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is **higher or lower**, and you will continue guessing.
5. Every time you guess a wrong number `x`, you will pay `x` dollars. If you run out of money, **you lose the game**.

Given a particular `n`, return the minimum amount of money you need to **guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick**.
