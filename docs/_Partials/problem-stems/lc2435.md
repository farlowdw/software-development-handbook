You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`. You are currently at position `(0, 0)` and you want to reach position `(m - 1, n - 1)` moving only **down** or **right**.

Return the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by `k`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
