You are given an array `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a point on an **X-Y** plane.

**Straight lines** are going to be added to the **X-Y** plane, such that every point is covered by at **least** one line.

Return the **minimum** number of **straight lines** needed to cover all the points.
