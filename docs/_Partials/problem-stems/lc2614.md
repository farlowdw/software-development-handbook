You are given a 0-indexed two-dimensional integer array `nums`.

Return the largest **prime** number that lies on at least one of the **diagonals** of `nums`. In case, no prime is present on any of the diagonals, return `0`.

Note that:

- An integer is **prime** if it is greater than `1` and has no positive integer divisors other than `1` and itself.
- An integer `val` is on one of the **diagonals** of `nums` if there exists an integer `i` for which `nums[i][i] = val` or an `i` for which `nums[i][nums.length - i - 1] = val`.

In the above diagram, one diagonal is `[1,5,9]` and another diagonal is `[3,5,7]`.
