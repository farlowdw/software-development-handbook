On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- `"G"`: go straight 1 unit;
- `"L"`: turn 90 degrees to the left;
- `"R"`: turn 90 degrees to the right.

The robot performs the `instructions` given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.
