You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of **positive** integers.

You can start at **any** cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:

- From a cell `(row, col)`, you can move to any of the cells: `(row - 1, col + 1)`, `(row, col + 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` such that the value of the cell you move to, should be **strictly** bigger than the value of the current cell.

Return the **maximum** number of **moves** that you can perform.
