There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with <code>x<sub>start</sub></code> and <code>x<sub>end</sub></code> bursts by an arrow shot at `x` if <code>x<sub>start</sub> ≤ x ≤ x<sub>end</sub></code>. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.

Given an array points where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>]</code>, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
