You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Return an integer that denotes the **sum** of elements in `nums` whose corresponding **indices** have **exactly** `k` set bits in their binary representation.

The **set bits** in an integer are the `1`'s present when it is written in binary.

- For example, the binary representation of `21` is `10101`, which has `3` set bits.
