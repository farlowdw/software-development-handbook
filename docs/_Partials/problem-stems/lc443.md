Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

- If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return the new length of the array.
 
**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(1)` extra space?
