Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

- Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
- Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (**0-indexed**).

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so <code>arr = [<u>1</u>,<u>2</u>,<u>3</u>,4]</code> after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return an array of the `k`-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.
