You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `dist` of size `n`, where `dist[i]` is the **initial distance** in meters of the `i`th monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a **constant** speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array `speed` of size `n`, where `speed[i]` is the speed of the `i`th monster in meters per minute.

The monsters start moving at **minute 0**. You have a weapon that you can **choose** to use at the start of every minute, including minute `0`. You cannot use the weapon in the middle of a minute. The weapon can eliminate any monster that is still alive. You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city **exactly** at the start of a minute, it counts as a **loss**, and the game ends before you can use your weapon in that minute.

Return the **maximum** number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or `n` if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.
