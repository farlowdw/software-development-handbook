A string `s` is **nice** if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, it appears **both** in uppercase and lowercase. For example, `"abABB"` is nice because `'A'` and `'a'` appear, and `'B'` and `'b'` appear. However, "abA" is not because `'b'` appears, but `'B'` does not.

Given a string `s`, return the longest **substring** of `s` that is **nice**. If there are multiple, return the substring of the **earliest** occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.
