The **k-beauty** of an integer `num` is defined as the number of **substrings** of `num` when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

- It has a length of `k`.
- It is a divisor of `num`.

Given integers `num` and `k`, return the k-beauty of `num`.

**Note:**

- **Leading zeros** are allowed.
- `0` is not a divisor of any value.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
