You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `nums`, where each string is of **equal length** and consists of only digits.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where <code>queries[i] = [k<sub>i</sub>, trim<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each `queries[i]`, you need to:

- **Trim** each number in `nums` to its **rightmost** <code>trim<sub>i</sub></code> digits.
- Determine the **index** of the <code>k<sub>i</sub>th</code> smallest trimmed number in `nums`. If two trimmed numbers are equal, the number with the **lower** index is considered to be smaller.
- Reset each number in `nums` to its original length.

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries`, where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

**Note:**

- To trim to the rightmost `x` digits means to keep removing the leftmost digit, until only `x` digits remain.
- Strings in `nums` may contain leading zeros.
