**Table:** `EmployeeShifts`

```
+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     |
+------------------+----------+
| employee_id      | int      |
| start_time       | datetime |
| end_time         | datetime |
+------------------+----------+
```

- `(employee_id, start_time)` is the unique key for this table.
- This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees, including the start time, and end time.

Write a solution to analyze overlapping shifts for each employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if they occur on the **same date** and one shift's `end_time` is later than another shift's `start_time`.

For **each employee**, calculate the following:

1. The **maximum** number of shifts that **overlap** at any **given time**.
2. The **total duration** of all overlaps in minutes.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id` in **ascending** order.

The query result format is in the following example.

- **Explanation:** 

- Employee `1` has `3` shifts:
  + `2023-10-01 09:00:00` to `2023-10-01 17:00:00`
  + `2023-10-01 15:00:00` to `2023-10-01 23:00:00`
  + `2023-10-01 16:00:00` to `2023-10-02 00:00:00`

    The maximum number of overlapping shifts is `3` (from `16:00` to `17:00`). The total overlap duration is: - `2` hours (`15:00`-`17:00`) between 1st and 2nd shifts - `1` hour (`16:00`-`17:00`) between 1st and 3rd shifts - `7` hours (`16:00`-`23:00`) between 2nd and 3rd shifts Total: `10` hours = `600` minutes
- Employee `2` has `2` shifts:
  + `2023-10-01 09:00:00` to `2023-10-01 17:00:00`
  + `2023-10-01 11:00:00` to `2023-10-01 19:00:00`

    The maximum number of overlapping shifts is `2`. The total overlap duration is `6` hours (`11:00`-`17:00`) = `360` minutes.
- Employee `3` has only 1 shift, so there are no overlaps.

The output table contains the `employee_id`, the maximum number of simultaneous overlaps, and the total overlap duration in minutes for each employee, ordered by `employee_id` in ascending order.
