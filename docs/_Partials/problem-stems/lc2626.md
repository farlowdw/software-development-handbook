Given an integer array `nums`, a reducer function `fn`, and an intial value `init`, return a **reduced** array.

A **reduced** array is created by applying the following operation: `val = fn(init, nums[0])`, `val = fn(val, nums[1])`, `val = fn(val, arr[2])`, `...` until every element in the array has been processed. The final value of `val` is returned.

If the length of the array is `0`, it should return `init`.

Please solve it without using the built-in `Array.reduce` method.
