You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges <code>times[i] = (u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>)</code>, where <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> is the source node, <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> is the target node, and <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.
