You are given an integer array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array **at most** once:

- Choose any integer `x` such that `nums` remains **non-empty** on removing all occurrences of `x`.
- Remove all occurrences of `x` from the array.

Return the **maximum** subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.
