Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones **arranged in a row**, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice** starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take `1`, `2` or `3` **stones** from the **first** remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is `0` initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob **play optimally**.

Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win or "Tie" if they end the game with the same score.
