You are given an array of non-negative integers `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you may choose **any** element from `nums` and **increment** it by `1`.

Return the **maximum product** of `nums` after **at most** `k` operations. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
