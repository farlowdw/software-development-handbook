You are the owner of a company that creates alloys using various types of metals. There are `n` different types of metals available, and you have access to `k` machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.

For the `i`th machine to create an alloy, it needs `composition[i][j]` units of metal of type `j`. Initially, you have `stock[i]` units of metal type `i`, and purchasing one unit of metal type `i` costs `cost[i]` coins.

Given integers `n`, `k`, `budget`, a **1-indexed** 2D array `composition`, and **1-indexed** arrays `stock` and `cost`, your goal is to **maximize** the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of `budget` coins.

**All alloys must be created with the same machine.**

Return the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.
