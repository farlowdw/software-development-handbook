Given a **0-indexed** integer **2D array** `nodes`, your task is to determine if the given array represents the **preorder** traversal of some **binary** tree.
Given a 0-indexed integer 2D array nodes, your task is to determine if the given array represents the preorder traversal of some binary tree.

For each index `i`, `nodes[i] = [id, parentId]`, where `id` is the id of the node at the index `i` and `parentId` is the id of its parent in the tree (if the node has no parent, then `parentId = -1`).

Return `true` if the given array represents the preorder traversal of some tree, and `false` otherwise.

**Note:** the **preorder** traversal of a tree is a recursive way to traverse a tree in which we first visit the current node, then we do the preorder traversal for the left child, and finally, we do it for the right child.
