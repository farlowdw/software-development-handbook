Design a system that manages the reservation state of `n` seats that are numbered from `1` to `n`.

Implement the `SeatManager` class:

- `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`. All seats are initially available.
- `int reserve()` Fetches the **smallest-numbered** unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
- `void unreserve(int seatNumber)` Unreserves the seat with the given `seatNumber`.
