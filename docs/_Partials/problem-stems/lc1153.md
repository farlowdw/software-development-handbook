Given two strings `str1` and `str2` of the same length, determine whether you can transform `str1` into `str2` by doing **zero or more** conversions.

In one conversion you can convert **all** occurrences of one character in `str1` to **any** other lowercase English character.

Return `true` if and only if you can transform `str1` into `str2`.
