You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The **depth** of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list `[1,[2,2],[[3],2],1]` has each integer's value set to its **depth**. Let `maxDepth` be the **maximum depth** of any integer.

The **weight** of an integer is `maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1`.

Return the sum of each integer in `nestedList` multiplied by its **weight**.
