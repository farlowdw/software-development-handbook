There is a grid with `n + 2` **horizontal** bars and `m + 2` **vertical** bars, and initially containing `1 x 1` unit cells.

The bars are **1-indexed**.

You are given the two integers, `n` and `m`.

You are also given two integer arrays: `hBars` and `vBars`.

- `hBars` contains **distinct** horizontal bars in the range `[2, n + 1]`.
- `vBars` contains **distinct** vertical bars in the range `[2, m + 1]`.

You are allowed to **remove** bars that satisfy any of the following conditions:

- If it is a horizontal bar, it must correspond to a value in `hBars`.
- If it is a vertical bar, it must correspond to a value in `vBars`.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** area of a **square-shaped** hole in the grid after removing some bars (**possibly none**).
