You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `["bef", "vyz"]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has **every string (row) in lexicographic order**. (i.e., `(strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1])`, and `(strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1])`, and so on). Return the minimum possible value of `answer.length`.
