Given a positive integer `n`, return the **punishment number** of `n`.

The **punishment number** of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:

- `1 <= i <= n`
- The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.
