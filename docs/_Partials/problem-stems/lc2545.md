There is a class with `m` students and `n` exams. You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `score`, where each row represents one student and `score[i][j]` denotes the score the `i`th student got in the `j`th exam. The matrix `score` contains **distinct** integers only.

You are also given an integer `k`. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the `k`th (**0-indexed**) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return the matrix after sorting it.
