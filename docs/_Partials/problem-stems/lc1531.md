[Run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `"aabccc"` we replace `"aa"` by `"a2"` and replace `"ccc"` by `"c3"`. Thus the compressed string becomes `"a2bc3"`.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete **at most** `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of `s` after deleting at most `k` characters.
