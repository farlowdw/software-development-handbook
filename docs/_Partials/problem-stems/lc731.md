Implement a `MyCalendarTwo` class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a **triple** booking.

Your class will have one method, `book(int start, int end)`. Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers x such that `start <= x < end`.

A triple booking happens when **three** events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all 3 events.)

For each call to the method `MyCalendar.book`, return `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a `triple` booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: `MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)`
