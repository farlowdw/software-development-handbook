You are given the array paths, where <code>paths[i] = [cityA<sub>i</sub>, cityB<sub>i</sub>]</code> means there exists a direct path going from <code>cityA<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>cityB<sub>i</sub></code>. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.
