There is a test that has `n` types of questions. You are given an integer `target` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `types` where <code>types[i] = [count<sub>i</sub>, marks<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there are <code>count<sub>i</sub></code> questions of the `i`th type, and each one of them is worth <code>marks<sub>i</sub></code> points.

Return the number of ways you can earn **exactly** `target` points in the exam. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that questions of the same type are indistinguishable.

- For example, if there are `3` questions of the same type, then solving the `1`st and `2`nd questions is the same as solving the `1`st and `3`rd questions, or the `2`nd and `3`rd questions.
