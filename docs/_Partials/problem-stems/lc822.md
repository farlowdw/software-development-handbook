On a table are `N` cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 

If the number `X` on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number `X` is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output `0`.

Here, `fronts[i]` and `backs[i]` represent the number on the front and back of card `i`. 

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.
