- `id` is the primary Key for this table.
- Each row contains an `id`, `track_name`, and `artist`.

Write an SQL query to find how many times each artist appeared on the spotify ranking list.

Return the result table having the artist's name along with the corresponding number of occurrences ordered by occurrence count in **descending** order. If the occurrences are equal, then it’s ordered by the artist’s name in **ascending** order.

The query result format is in the following example​​​​​​.
