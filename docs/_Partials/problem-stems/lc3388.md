You are given an array `nums`.

A split of an array `nums` is **beautiful** if:

1. The array `nums` is split into three **non-empty subarrays**: `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`, such that `nums` can be formed by concatenating `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3` in that order.
2. The subarray `nums1` is a prefix of `nums2` **OR** `nums2` is a prefix of `nums3`.

Return the **number of ways** you can make this split.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

A **prefix** of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.
