A scenic location is represented by its `name` and attractiveness `score`, where `name` is a **unique** string among all locations and `score` is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The **higher** the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the **lexicographically smaller** name is better.

You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

- **Adding** scenic locations, **one at a time**.
- **Querying** the `i`th **best** location of **all locations already added**, where `i` is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
  + For example, when the system is queried for the `4`th time, it returns the `4`th best location of all locations already added.

Note that the test data are generated so that **at any time**, the number of queries **does not exceed** the number of locations added to the system.

Implement the `SORTracker` class:

- `SORTracker()` Initializes the tracker system.
- `void add(string name, int score)` Adds a scenic location with `name` and `score` to the system.
- `string get()` Queries and returns the `i`th best location, where `i` is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).
