You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `buses` of length `n`, where `buses[i]` represents the departure time of the `i`th bus. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `passengers` of length `m`, where `passengers[j]` represents the arrival time of the `j`th passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.

You are given an integer `capacity`, which represents the **maximum** number of passengers that can get on each bus.

When a passenger arrives, they will wait in line for the next available bus. You can get on a bus that departs at `x` minutes if you arrive at `y` minutes where `y <= x`, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the **earliest** arrival times get on the bus first.

More formally when a bus arrives, either:

- If `capacity` or fewer passengers are waiting for a bus, they will **all** get on the bus, or
- The `capacity` passengers with the **earliest** arrival times will get on the bus.

Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You **cannot** arrive at the same time as another passenger.

**Note:** The arrays `buses` and `passengers` are not necessarily sorted.
