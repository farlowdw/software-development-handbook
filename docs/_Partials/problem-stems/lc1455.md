Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**, and a `searchWord`.

You have to check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return the index of the word in `sentence` where `searchWord` is a prefix of this word (**1-indexed**).

If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If there is no such word return `-1`.

A **prefix** of a string `S` is any leading contiguous substring of `S`.
