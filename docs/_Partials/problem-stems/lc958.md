Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a [complete binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and <code>2<sup>h</sup></code> nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.
