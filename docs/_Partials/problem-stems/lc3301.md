You are given an array `maximumHeight`, where `maximumHeight[i]` denotes the **maximum** height the `i`th tower can be assigned.

Your task is to assign a height to each tower so that:

1. The height of the `i`th tower is a positive integer and does not exceed `maximumHeight[i]`.
2. No two towers have the same height.

Return the **maximum** possible total sum of the tower heights. If it's not possible to assign heights, return `-1`.
