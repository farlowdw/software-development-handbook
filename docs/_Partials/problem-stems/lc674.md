Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.
