There are some red and blue tiles arranged circularly. You are given an array of integers `colors` and a 2D integers array `queries`.

The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:

- `colors[i] == 0` means that tile `i` is **red**.
- `colors[i] == 1` means that tile `i` is **blue**.

An **alternating** group is a contiguous subset of tiles in the circle with **alternating** colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its **adjacent** tiles in the group).

You have to process queries of two types:

- <code>queries[i] = [1, size<sub>i</sub>]</code>, determine the count of **alternating** groups with <code>size size<sub>i</sub></code>.
- <code>queries[i] = [2, index<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>]</code>, change <code>colors[index<sub>i</sub>]</code> to <code>color<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return an array `answer` containing the results of the queries of the first type in order.

**Note** that since `colors` represents a **circle**, the **first** and the **last** tiles are considered to be next to each other.
