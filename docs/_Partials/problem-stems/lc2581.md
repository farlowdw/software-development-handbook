Alice has an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several **guesses** about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

- Chooses two **distinct** integers `u` and `v` such that there exists an edge `[u, v]` in the tree.
- He tells Alice that `u` is the **parent** of `v` in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array `guesses` where <code>guesses[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates Bob guessed <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> to be the parent of <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that **at least** `k` of his guesses are `true`.

Given the 2D integer arrays `edges`, `guesses` and the integer `k`, return the **number of possible nodes** that can be the root of Alice's tree. If there is no such tree, return `0`.
