A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

- For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`.

Given an integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

- For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.

The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

- For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`.
