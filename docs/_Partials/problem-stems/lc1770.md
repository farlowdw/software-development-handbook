You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are **1-indexed**.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

- Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
- Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
- Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return the **maximum** score after performing `m` operations.
