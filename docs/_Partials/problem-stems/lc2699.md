You are given an **undirected weighted connected** graph containing `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

Some edges have a weight of `-1` (<code>w<sub>i</sub> = -1</code>), while others have a **positive** weight (<code>w<sub>i</sub> > 0</code>).

Your task is to modify **all edges** with a weight of `-1` by assigning them **positive integer values** in the range <code>[1, 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>]</code> so that the **shortest distance** between the nodes `source` and `destination` becomes equal to an integer `target`. If there are **multiple modifications** that make the shortest distance between `source` and `destination` equal to `target`, any of them will be considered correct.

Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from `source` to `destination` equal to `target`, or an **empty array** if it's impossible.

**Note:** You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial positive weights.
