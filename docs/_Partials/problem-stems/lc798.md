Given an array `A`, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer `K` so that the array becomes `A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1]`.  Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth `1` point. 

For example, if we have `[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]`, and we rotate by `K = 2`, it becomes `[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]`.  This is worth `3` points because `1 > 0` [no points], `3 > 1` [no points], `0 <= 2` [one point], `2 <= 3` [one point], `4 <= 4` [one point].

Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index `K` that corresponds to the highest score we could receive. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index `K`.
