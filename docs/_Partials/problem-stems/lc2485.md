Given a positive integer `n`, find the **pivot integer** `x` such that:

- The sum of all elements between `1` and `x` inclusively equals the sum of all elements between `x` and `n` inclusively.
- Return the pivot integer `x`. If no such integer exists, return `-1`. It is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot index for the given input.
