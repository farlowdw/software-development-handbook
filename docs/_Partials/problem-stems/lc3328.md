**Table:** `Cities`

```

| Column Name | Type    | 
+-------------+---------+
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `(state, city)` is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.

Write a solution to find **all the cities** in **each state** and analyze them based on the following requirements:

- Combine all cities into a **comma-separated** string for each state.
- Only include states that have **at least** `3` cities.
- Only include states where **at least one city** starts with the **same letter as the state name**.

Return the result table ordered by the count of matching-letter cities in **descending** order and then by state name in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

- **Input:** 

```
Cities table:
+--------------+---------------+
| state        | city          |
+--------------+---------------+
| New York     | New York City |
| New York     | Newark        |
| New York     | Buffalo       |
| New York     | Rochester     |
| California   | San Francisco |
| California   | Sacramento    |
| California   | San Diego     |
| California   | Los Angeles   |
| Texas        | Tyler         |
| Texas        | Temple        |
| Texas        | Taylor        |
| Texas        | Dallas        |
| Pennsylvania | Philadelphia  |
| Pennsylvania | Pittsburgh    |
| Pennsylvania | Pottstown     |
+--------------+---------------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| state       | cities                                    | matching_letter_count |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Pennsylvania| Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown       | 3                     |
| Texas       | Dallas, Taylor, Temple, Tyler             | 3                     |
| New York    | Buffalo, Newark, New York City, Rochester | 2                     |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
```

- **Explanation:** 

- **Pennsylvania:**
  + Has 3 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  + All 3 cities start with `'P'` (same as state)
  + `matching_letter_count = 3`
- **Texas:**
  + Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  + 3 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with `'T'` (same as state)
  + `matching_letter_count = 3`
- **New York:**
  + Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  + 2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with `'N'` (same as state)
  + `matching_letter_count = 2`
- **California** is not included in the output because:
  + Although it has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
  + No cities start with `'C'` (doesn't meet the matching letter requirement)

**Note:**

- Results are ordered by `matching_letter_count` in descending order
- When `matching_letter_count` is the same (Texas and New York both have 2), they are ordered by state name alphabetically
- Cities in each row are ordered alphabetically
