You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is the number of elements that will be in the array at time `i`. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of times you can **resize** the array (to **any** size).

The size of the array at time `t`, <code>size<sub>t</sub></code>, must be at least `nums[t]` because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The **space wasted** at time `t` is defined as <code>size<sub>t</sub> - nums[t]</code>, and the **total** space wasted is the **sum** of the space wasted across every time `t` where `0 <= t < nums.length`.

Return the **minimum total space wasted** if you can resize the array at most `k` times.

**Note:** The array can have **any size** at the start and does **not** count towards the number of resizing operations.
