You are given a 2D integer array intervals where <code>intervals[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the **inclusive** interval <code>[left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more **groups** such that each interval is in **exactly** one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group **intersect** each other.

Return the minimum number of groups you need to make.

Two intervals **intersect** if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals `[1, 5]` and `[5, 8]` intersect.
