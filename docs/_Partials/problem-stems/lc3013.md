You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`, and two **positive** integers `k` and `dist`.

The **cost** of an array is the value of its **first** element. For example, the cost of `[1,2,3]` is `1` while the cost of `[3,4,1]` is `3`.

You need to divide `nums` into `k` **disjoint contiguous** subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the **second** subarray and the starting index of the `k`th subarray should be **less than or equal to** `dist`. In other words, if you divide `nums` into the subarrays <code>nums[0..(i<sub>1</sub> - 1)], nums[i<sub>1</sub>..(i<sub>2</sub> - 1)], ..., nums[i<sub>k-1</sub>..(n - 1)]</code>, then <code>i<sub>k-1</sub> - i<sub>1</sub> &lt;= dist</code>.

Return the **minimum** possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.
