Given two positive integers `left` and `right`, find the two integers `num1` and `num2` such that:

- `left <= nums1 < nums2 <= right`
- `nums1` and `nums2` are both **prime** numbers.
- `nums2 - nums1` is the **minimum** amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.

Return the positive integer array `ans = [nums1, nums2]`. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum `nums1` value or `[-1, -1]` if such numbers do not exist.

A number greater than `1` is called **prime** if it is only divisible by `1` and itself.
