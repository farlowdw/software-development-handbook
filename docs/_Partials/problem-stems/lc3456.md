You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Determine if there exists a substring of length exactly `k` in `s` that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The substring consists of only one distinct character (e.g., `"aaa"` or `"bbb"`).
2. If there is a character immediately before the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.
3. If there is a character immediately after the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return `true` if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return `false`.
