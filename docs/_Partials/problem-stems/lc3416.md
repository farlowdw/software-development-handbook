Given an integer array `nums`, find the number of subsequences of size `5` of `nums` with a **unique middle mode**.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **mode** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the element that appears the **maximum** number of times in the sequence.

A sequence of numbers contains a **unique mode** if it has only one mode.

A sequence of numbers `seq` of size `5` contains a **unique middle mode** if the *middle element* (`seq[2]`) is a **unique mode**.
