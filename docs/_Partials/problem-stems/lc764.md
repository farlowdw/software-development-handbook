In a 2D `grid` from `(0, 0)` to `(N-1, N-1)`, every cell contains a `1`, except those cells in the given list mines which are `0`. What is the largest axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s contained in the grid? Return the order of the plus sign. If there is none, return `0`.

An "axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s of order `k`" has some center `grid[x][y] = 1` along with `4` arms of length `k-1` going up, down, left, and right, and made of `1`s. This is demonstrated in the diagrams below. Note that there could be `0`s or `1`s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for `1`s.
