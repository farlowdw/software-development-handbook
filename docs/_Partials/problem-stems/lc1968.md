You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of **distinct** integers. You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element in the rearranged array is **not** equal to the **average** of its neighbors.

More formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for every `i` in the range `1 <= i < nums.length - 1`, `(nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2` is **not** equal to `nums[i]`.

Return **any** rearrangement of `nums` that meets the requirements.
