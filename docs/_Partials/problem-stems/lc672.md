There is a room with `n` lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly `m` unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the `n` lights could be.

1. Flip all the lights.
2. Flip lights with even numbers.
3. Flip lights with odd numbers.
