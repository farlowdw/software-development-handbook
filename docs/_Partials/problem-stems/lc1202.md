You are given a string `s`, and an array of pairs of indices in the string `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [a, b]` indicates `2` indices (**0-indexed**) of the string.

You can swap the characters at any pair of indices in the given `pairs` **any number of times**.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that `s` can be changed to after using the swaps.
