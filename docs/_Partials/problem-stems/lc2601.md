You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:

- Pick an index `i` that you haven't picked before, and pick a prime `p` **strictly less than** `nums[i]`, then subtract `p` from `nums[i]`.

Return true if you can make `nums` a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.

A **strictly increasing array** is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.
