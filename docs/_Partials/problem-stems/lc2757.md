Given a **circular** array `arr` and an integer `startIndex`, return a generator object `gen` that yields values from `arr`. The first time `gen.next()` is called on the generator, it should should yield `arr[startIndex]`. Each subsequent time `gen.next()` is called, an integer `jump` will be passed into the function (Ex: `gen.next(-3)`).

- If `jump` is positive, the index should increase by that value, however if the current index is the last index, it should instead jump to the first index.
- If `jump` is negative, the index should decrease by the magnitude of that value, however if the current index is the first index, it should instead jump to the last index.
