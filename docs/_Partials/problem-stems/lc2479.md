There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. The root of the tree is the node labeled `0`.

Each node has an associated **value**. You are given an array `values` of length `n`, where `values[i]` is the **value** of the `i`th node.

Select any two **non-overlapping** subtrees. Your **score** is the bitwise XOR of the sum of the values within those subtrees.

Return the **maximum** possible **score** you can achieve. If it is impossible to find two nonoverlapping subtrees, return `0`.

**Note** that:

- The **subtree** of a node is the tree consisting of that node and all of its descendants.
- Two subtrees are **non-overlapping** if they do not share **any common** node.
