You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `numSlots` such that `2 * numSlots >= n`. There are `numSlots` slots numbered from `1` to `numSlots`.

You have to place all `n` integers into the slots such that each slot contains at **most** two numbers. The **AND sum** of a given placement is the sum of the **bitwise** `AND` of every number with its respective slot number.

- For example, the **AND sum** of placing the numbers `[1, 3]` into slot <code><u>1</u></code> and `[4, 6]` into slot <code><u>2</u></code> is equal to <code>(1 AND <u>1</u>) + (3 AND <u>1</u>) + (4 AND <u>2</u>) + (6 AND <u>2</u>) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 4</code>.

Return the maximum possible **AND sum** of `nums` given `numSlots` slots.
