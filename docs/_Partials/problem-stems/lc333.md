Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the largest number of nodes.

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:

- The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
- The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.

**Note:** A subtree must include all of its descendants.

**Follow up:** Can you figure out ways to solve it with `O(n)` time complexity?
