You are given a 2D integer `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can **add** `x` to or **subtract** `x` from any element in the `grid`.

A **uni-value grid** is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make the grid **uni-value**. If it is not possible, return `-1`.
