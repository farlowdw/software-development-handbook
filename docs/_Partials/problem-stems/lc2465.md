You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length.

As long as `nums` is **not** empty, you must repetitively:

- Find the minimum number in `nums` and remove it.
- Find the maximum number in `nums` and remove it.
- Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.

The **average** of two numbers `a` and `b` is `(a + b) / 2`.

- For example, the average of `2` and `3` is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Return the number of **distinct** averages calculated using the above process.

**Note** that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum number, any can be removed.
