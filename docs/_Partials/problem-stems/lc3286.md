You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` and an integer `health`.

You start on the upper-left corner `(0, 0)` and would like to get to the lower-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another adjacent cell as long as your health remains **positive**.

Cells `(i, j)` with `grid[i][j] = 1` are considered **unsafe** and reduce your health by `1`.

Return `true` if you can reach the final cell with a health value of `1` or more, and `false` otherwise.
