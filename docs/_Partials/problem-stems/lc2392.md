You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given:

- a 2D integer array `rowConditions` of size `n` where <code>rowConditions[i] = [above<sub>i</sub>, below<sub>i</sub>]</code>, and
- a 2D integer array `colConditions` of size `m` where <code>colConditions[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The two arrays contain integers from `1` to `k`.

You have to build a `k x k` matrix that contains each of the numbers from `1` to `k` **exactly once**. The remaining cells should have the value `0`.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

- The number <code>above<sub>i</sub></code> should appear in a **row** that is strictly **above** the row at which the number <code>below<sub>i</sub></code> appears for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.
- The number <code>left<sub>i</sub></code> should appear in a **column** that is strictly **left** of the column at which the number <code>right<sub>i</sub></code> appears for all `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.

Return **any** matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.
