You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer, and an integer `k`.

We call some integer **wonderful** if it is a **permutation** of the digits in `num` and is **greater in value** than `num`. There can be many wonderful integers. However, we only care about the **smallest-valued** ones.

For example, when `num = "5489355142"`:

- The 1st smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355214"`.
- The 2nd smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355241"`.
- The 3rd smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355412"`.
- The 4th smallest wonderful integer is `"5489355421"`.

Return the **minimum number of adjacent digit swaps** that needs to be applied to `num` to reach the `k`th **smallest wonderful** integer.

The tests are generated in such a way that `k`th smallest wonderful integer exists.
