Given four lists `A, B, C, D` of integer values, compute how many tuples `(i, j, k, l)` there are such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all `A, B, C, D` have same length of `N` where `0 ≤ N ≤ 500`. All integers are in the range of <code>-2<sup>28</sup></code> to <code>2<sup>28</sup> - 1</code> and the result is guaranteed to be at most <code>2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>.
