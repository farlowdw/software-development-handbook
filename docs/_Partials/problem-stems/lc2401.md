You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

We call a subarray of `nums` **nice** if the bitwise **AND** of every pair of elements that are in **different** positions in the subarray is equal to `0`.

Return the length of the **longest** nice subarray.

A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.

**Note** that subarrays of length `1` are always considered nice.
