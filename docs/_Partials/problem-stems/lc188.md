You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
