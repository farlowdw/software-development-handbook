You are given an integer `n` and an object `categoryHandler` of class `CategoryHandler`.

There are `n` elements, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each element has a category, and your task is to find the number of unique categories.

The class `CategoryHandler` contains the following function, which may help you:

- `boolean haveSameCategory(integer a, integer b)`: Returns `true` if `a` and `b` are in the same category and `false` otherwise. Also, if either `a` or `b` is not a valid number (i.e., it's greater than or equal to `n` or less than `0`), it returns `false`.

Return the number of unique categories.
