A decimal number can be converted to its Hexspeak representation by first converting it to an uppercase hexadecimal string, then replacing all occurrences of the digit `0` with the letter `O`, and the digit `1` with the letter `I`.  Such a representation is valid if and only if it consists only of the letters in the set `{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "I", "O"}`.

Given a string `num` representing a decimal integer `N`, return the Hexspeak representation of `N` if it is valid, otherwise return `"ERROR"`.
