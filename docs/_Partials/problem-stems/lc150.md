Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.
