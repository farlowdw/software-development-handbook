You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`.

You need to select a subset of `nums` which satisfies the following condition:

- You can place the selected elements in a **0-indexed** array such that it follows the pattern: <code>[x, x<sup>2</sup>, x<sup>4</sup>, ..., x<sup>k/2</sup>, x<sup>k</sup>, x<sup>k/2</sup>, ..., x<sup>4</sup>, x<sup>2</sup>, x]</code> (**Note** that `k` can be be any **non-negative** power of `2`). For example, `[2, 4, 16, 4, 2]` and `[3, 9, 3]` follow the pattern while `[2, 4, 8, 4, 2]` does not.

Return the **maximum** number of elements in a subset that satisfies these conditions.
