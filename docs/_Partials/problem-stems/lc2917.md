You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`.

The **K-or** of `nums` is a non-negative integer that satisfies the following:

- The `i`th bit is set in the K-or **if and only if** there are at least `k` elements of `nums` in which bit `i` is set.

Return the **K-or** of `nums`.

**Note** that a bit `i` is set in `x` if <code>(2<sup>i</sup> AND x) == 2<sup>i</sup></code>, where `AND` is the bitwise `AND` operator.
