Given an array `arr` that represents a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`. You have a binary string of size `n` that initially has all its bits set to zero.

At each step `i` (assuming both the binary string and `arr` are 1-indexed) from `1` to `n`, the bit at position `arr[i]` is set to `1`. You are given an integer `m` and you need to find the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length `m`. A group of ones is a contiguous substring of `1`s such that it cannot be extended in either direction.

Return the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length exactly `m`. If no such group exists, return `-1`.
