The power of an integer `x` is defined as the number of steps needed to transform `x` into `1` using the following steps:

- if `x` is even then `x = x / 2`
- if `x` is odd then `x = 3 * x + 1`

For example, the power of `x = 3` is `7` because `3` needs `7` steps to become `1` (`3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1`).

Given three integers `lo`, `hi` and `k`. The task is to sort all integers in the interval `[lo, hi]` by the power value in **ascending order**, if two or more integers have **the same** power value sort them by **ascending order**.

Return the `k`th integer in the range `[lo, hi]` sorted by the power value.

Notice that for any integer `x` (`lo <= x <= hi`) it is **guaranteed** that `x` will transform into `1` using these steps and that the power of `x` is will **fit** in 32 bit signed integer.
