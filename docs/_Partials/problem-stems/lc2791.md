You are given a **tree** (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) **rooted** at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a **0-indexed** array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to the edge between `i` and `parent[i]`. `s[0]` can be ignored.

Return the number of pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and the characters assigned to edges on the path from `u` to `v` can be **rearranged** to form a **palindrome**.

A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backwards as forwards.
