You are given a **0-indexed** array `usageLimits` of length `n`.

Your task is to create **groups** using numbers from `0` to `n - 1`, ensuring that each number, `i`, is used no more than `usageLimits[i]` times in total **across all groups**. You must also satisfy the following conditions:

- Each group must consist of **distinct** numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
- Each group (except the first one) must have a length **strictly greater** than the previous group.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** number of groups you can create while satisfying these conditions.
