Given an array of integers `nums`, you start with an initial **positive** value `startValue`.

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of `startValue` plus elements in `nums` (from left to right).

Return the minimum **positive** value of `startValue` such that the step by step sum is never less than `1`.
