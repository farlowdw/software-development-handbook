Implement the `StreamChecker` class as follows:

- `StreamChecker(words)`: Constructor, init the data structure with the given words.
- `query(letter)`: returns true if and only if for some `k >= 1`, the last `k` characters queried (in order from oldest to newest, including this letter just queried) spell one of the words in the given list.
