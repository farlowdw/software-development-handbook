There is a snake in an `n x n` matrix `grid` and can move in **four possible directions**. Each cell in the `grid` is identified by the position: `grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of the `grid` and an array of strings `commands` where each `command[i]` is either `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the `grid` boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing `commands`.
