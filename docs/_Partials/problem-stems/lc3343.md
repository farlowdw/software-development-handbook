You are given a string `num`. A string of digits is called **balanced** if the sum of the digits at even indices is equal to the sum of the digits at odd indices.

Return the number of **distinct permutations** of `num` that are **balanced**.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **permutation** is a rearrangement of all the characters of a string.
