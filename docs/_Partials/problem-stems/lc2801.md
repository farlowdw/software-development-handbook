Given two positive integers `low` and `high` represented as strings, find the count of **stepping numbers** in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

A **stepping number** is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of **exactly** `1`.

Return an integer denoting the count of stepping numbers in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note:** A stepping number should not have a leading zero.
