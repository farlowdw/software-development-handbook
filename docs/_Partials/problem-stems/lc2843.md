You are given two positive integers `low` and `high`.

An integer `x` consisting of `2 * n` digits is **symmetric** if the sum of the first `n` digits of `x` is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits of `x`. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.

Return the **number of symmetric** integers in the range `[low, high]`.
