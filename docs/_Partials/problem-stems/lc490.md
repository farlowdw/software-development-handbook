There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up**, **down**, **left** or **right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's `start` position and the destination, where <code>start = [start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>]</code> and <code>destination = [destination<sub>row</sub>, destination<sub>col</sub>]</code>, return `true` if the ball can stop at the destination, otherwise return `false`.

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).
