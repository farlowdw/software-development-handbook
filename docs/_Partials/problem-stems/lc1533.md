We have an integer array `arr`, where all the integers in arr are equal except for one integer which is **larger** than the rest of the integers. You will not be given direct access to the array, instead, you will have an **API** `ArrayReader` which have the following functions:

- `int compareSub(int l, int r, int x, int y)`: where `0 <= l, r, x, y < ArrayReader.length(), l <= r` and `x <= y`. The function compares the sum of sub-array `arr[l..r]` with the sum of the sub-array `arr[x..y]` and returns:
  + `1` if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] > arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`
  + `0` if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] == arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`
  + `-1` if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] < arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`
- `int length()`: Returns the size of the array.

You are allowed to call `compareSub()` **20 times** at most. You can assume both functions work in `O(1)` time.

Return the index of the array `arr` which has the largest integer.

**Follow-up:**

- What if there are two numbers in `arr` that are bigger than all other numbers?
- What if there is one number that is bigger than other numbers and one number that is smaller than other numbers?
