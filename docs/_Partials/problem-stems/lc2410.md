You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `players`, where `players[i]` represents the **ability** of the `i`th player. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `trainers`, where `trainers[j]` represents the **training capacity** of the `j`th trainer.

The `i`th player can **match** with the `j`th trainer if the player's ability is **less than or equal to** the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the `i`th player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the `j`th trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return the **maximum** number of matchings between `players` and `trainers` that satisfy these conditions.
