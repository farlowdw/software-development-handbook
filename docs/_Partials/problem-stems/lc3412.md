You are given a string `s`.

We define the **mirror** of a letter in the English alphabet as its corresponding letter when the alphabet is reversed. For example, the mirror of `'a'` is `'z'`, and the mirror of `'y'` is `'b'`.

Initially, all characters in the string `s` are **unmarked**.

You start with a score of `0`, and you perform the following process on the string `s`:

- Iterate through the string from left to right.
- At each index `i`, find the closest **unmarked** index `j` such that `j < i` and `s[j]` is the mirror of `s[i]`. Then, **mark** both indices `i` and `j`, and add the value `i - j` to the total score.
- If no such index `j` exists for the index `i`, move on to the next index without making any changes.

Return the total score at the end of the process.
