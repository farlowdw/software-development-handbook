You are given a **0-indexed binary** string `floor`, which represents the colors of tiles on a floor:

- `floor[i] = '0'` denotes that the `i`th tile of the floor is colored **black**.
- On the other hand, `floor[i] = '1'` denotes that the `i`th tile of the floor is colored **white**.

You are also given `numCarpets` and `carpetLen`. You have `numCarpets` **black** carpets, each of length `carpetLen` tiles. Cover the tiles with the given carpets such that the number of **white** tiles still visible is **minimum**. Carpets may overlap one another.

Return the **minimum** number of white tiles still visible.
