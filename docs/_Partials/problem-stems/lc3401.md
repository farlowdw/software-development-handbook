CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS

**Table:** `SecretSanta`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| giver_id    | int  |
| receiver_id | int  |
| gift_value  | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `(giver_id, receiver_id)` is the unique key for this table.   
- Each row represents a record of a gift exchange between two employees, `giver_id` represents the employee who gives a gift, `receiver_id` represents the employee who receives the gift and `gift_value` represents the value of the gift given.  

Write a solution to find the **total gift value** and **length** of **circular chains** of Secret Santa gift exchanges:

A **circular chain** is defined as a series of exchanges where:

- Each employee gives a gift to **exactly one** other employee.
- Each employee receives a gift **from exactly** one other employee.
- The exchanges form a continuous **loop** (e.g., employee A gives a gift to B, B gives to C, and C gives back to A).

Return the result ordered by the chain length and total gift value of the chain in descending order. 

The result format is in the following example.

- **Input:** 

```
SecretSanta table:

+----------+-------------+------------+
| giver_id | receiver_id | gift_value |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2           | 20         |
| 2        | 3           | 30         |
| 3        | 1           | 40         |
| 4        | 5           | 25         |
| 5        | 4           | 35         |
+----------+-------------+------------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+----------+--------------+------------------+
| chain_id | chain_length | total_gift_value |
+----------+--------------+------------------+
| 1        | 3            | 90               |
| 2        | 2            | 60               |
+----------+--------------+------------------+
```

- **Explanation:** 

- Chain `1` involves employees `1`, `2`, and `3`:
  + Employee `1` gives a gift to `2`, employee `2` gives a gift to `3`, and employee `3` gives a gift to `1`.
  + Total gift value for this chain `= 20 + 30 + 40 = 90`.
- Chain `2` involves employees `4` and `5`:
  + Employee `4` gives a gift to `5`, and employee `5` gives a gift to `4`.
  + Total gift value for this chain `= 25 + 35 = 60`.

The result table is ordered by the chain length and total gift value of the chain in descending order.
