A string is **beautiful** if:

- It consists of the first `k` letters of the English lowercase alphabet.
- It does not contain any substring of length `2` or more which is a palindrome.

You are given a beautiful string `s` of length `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Return the lexicographically smallest string of length `n`, which is larger than `s` and is **beautiful**. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`.

- For example, `"abcd"` is lexicographically larger than `"abcc"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.
