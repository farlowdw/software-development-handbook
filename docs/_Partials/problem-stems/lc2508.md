There is an **undirected** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a **2D** array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub>.</code> The graph can be disconnected.

You can add **at most** two additional edges (possibly none) to this graph so that there are no repeated edges and no self-loops.

Return `true` if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph even, otherwise return false.

The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
