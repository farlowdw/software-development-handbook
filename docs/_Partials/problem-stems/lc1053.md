Given an array of positive integers `arr` (not necessarily distinct), return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than `arr`, that can be **made with exactly one swap** (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`). If it cannot be done, then return the same array.
