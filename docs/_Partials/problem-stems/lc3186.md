A magician has various spells.

You are given an array `power`, where each element represents the damage of a spell. Multiple spells can have the same damage value.

It is a known fact that if a magician decides to cast a spell with a damage of `power[i]`, they **cannot** cast any spell with a damage of `power[i] - 2`, `power[i] - 1`, `power[i] + 1`, or `power[i] + 2`.

Each spell can be cast **only once**.

Return the **maximum** possible total damage that a magician can cast.
