You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` both of **unique** elements, where `nums1` is a subset of nums2.

Find all the next greater numbers for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.

The Next Greater Number of a number `x` in `nums1` is the first greater number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, return `-1` for this number.
