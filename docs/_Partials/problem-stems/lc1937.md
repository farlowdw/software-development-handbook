You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (**0-indexed**). Starting with `0` points, you want to **maximize** the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in **each row**. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will **add** `points[r][c]` to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates <code>(r, c<sub>1</sub>)</code> and <code>(r + 1, c<sub>2</sub>)</code> will **subtract** <code>abs(c<sub>1</sub> - c<sub>2</sub>)</code> from your score.

Return the **maximum** number of points you can achieve.

`abs(x)` is defined as:

- `x` for `x >= 0`.
- `-x` for `x < 0`.
