You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers, and a 2D integer array `queries` of size `q`, where <code>queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

For each query, you must find the **maximum XOR score** of any subarray of <code>nums[l<sub>i</sub>..r<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The **XOR score** of an array `a` is found by repeatedly applying the following operations on `a` so that only one element remains, that is the `score`:

- Simultaneously replace `a[i]` with `a[i] XOR a[i + 1]` for all indices `i` except the last one.
- Remove the last element of `a`.

Return an array `answer` of size `q` where `answer[i]` is the answer to query `i`.
