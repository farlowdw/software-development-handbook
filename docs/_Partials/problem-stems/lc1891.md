You are given an integer array `ribbons`, where `ribbons[i]` represents the length of the `i`th ribbon, and an integer `k`. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of **positive integer** lengths, or perform no cuts at all.

For example, if you have a ribbon of length `4`, you can:

- Keep the ribbon of length `4`,
- Cut it into one ribbon of length `3` and one ribbon of length `1`,
- Cut it into two ribbons of length `2`,
- Cut it into one ribbon of length `2` and two ribbons of length `1`, or
- Cut it into four ribbons of length `1`.

Your goal is to obtain `k` ribbons of all the **same positive integer length**. You are allowed to throw away any excess ribbon as a result of cutting.

Return the **maximum** possible positive integer length that you can obtain `k` ribbons of, or `0` if you cannot obtain `k` ribbons of the same length.
