You are given a string `s` containing lowercase letters and an integer `k`. You need to:

- First, change some characters of `s` to other lowercase English letters.
- Then divide `s` into `k` non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring is palindrome.

Return the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide the string.
