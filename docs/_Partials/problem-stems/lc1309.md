Given a string `s` formed by digits (`'0' - '9'`) and `'#'`. We want to map `s` to English lowercase characters as follows:

- Characters (`'a'` to `'i'`) are represented by (`'1'` to `'9'`) respectively.
- Characters (`'j'` to `'z'`) are represented by (`'10#'` to `'26#'`) respectively. 

Return the string formed after mapping.

It's guaranteed that a unique mapping will always exist.
