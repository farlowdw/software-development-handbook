In an `n*n` grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at `(n-1, n-2)` and `(n-1, n-1)`.

In one move the snake can:

- Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.
- Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.
- Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)` to `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)`.

Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` to `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)`.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the target.

If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.
