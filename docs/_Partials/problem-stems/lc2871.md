You are given an array `nums` consisting of **non-negative** integers.

We define the score of subarray `nums[l..r]` such that `l <= r` as `nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] AND ... AND nums[r]` where `AND` is the bitwise `AND` operation.

Consider splitting the array into one or more subarrays such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- **Each** element of the array belongs to **exactly** one subarray.
- The sum of scores of the subarrays is the **minimum** possible.

Return the **maximum** number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.
