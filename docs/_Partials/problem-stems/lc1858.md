Given an array of strings `words`, find the **longest** string in `words` such that **every prefix** of it is also in `words`.

- For example, let `words = ["a", "app", "ap"]`. The string `"app"` has prefixes `"ap"` and `"a"`, all of which are in `words`.

Return the string described above. If there is more than one string with the same length, return the **lexicographically smallest** one, and if no string exists, return `""`.
