Given a `root` of an N-ary tree, return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its children.

```
class Node {
  public int val;
  public List<Node> children;
}
```

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
