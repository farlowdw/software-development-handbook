Given an integer array `data` representing the data, return whether it is a valid **UTF-8** encoding.

A character in **UTF8** can be from **1 to 4 bytes** long, subjected to the following rules:

1. For a **1-byte** character, the first bit is a `0`, followed by its Unicode code.
2. For an **n-bytes** character, the first `n` bits are all one's, the `n + 1` bit is `0`, followed by `n - 1` bytes with the most significant `2` bits being `10`.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

```
   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

**Note:** The input is an array of integers. Only the **least significant 8 bits** of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.
