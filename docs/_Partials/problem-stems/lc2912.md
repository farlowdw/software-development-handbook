You are given two integers `n` and `m` which represent the size of a **1-indexed** grid. You are also given an integer `k`, a **1-indexed** integer array `source` and a **1-indexed** integer array `dest`, where `source` and `dest` are in the form `[x, y]` representing a cell on the given grid.

You can move through the grid in the following way:

- You can go from cell <code>[x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>]</code> to cell <code>[x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>]</code> if either <code>x<sub>1</sub> == x<sub>2</sub></code> or <code>y<sub>1</sub> == y<sub>2</sub></code>.
- Note that you **can't** move to the cell you are already in e.g. <code>x<sub>1</sub> == x<sub>2</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>1</sub> == y<sub>2</sub></code>.

Return the number of ways you can reach `dest` from `source` by moving through the grid **exactly** `k` times.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
