**Table:** `Orders`

```
+-------------+------+ 
| Column Name | Type | 
+-------------+------+ 
| minute      | int  | 
| order_count | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

- `minute` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the minute and number of orders received during that specific minute. The total number of rows will be a multiple of 6.

Write a query to calculate **total orders** within each **interval**. Each interval is defined as a combination of `6` minutes.

- Minutes `1` to `6` fall within interval `1`, while minutes `7` to `12` belong to interval `2`, and so forth.

Return the result table ordered by **interval_no** in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.
