You are given two integers `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

You are also given the `head` of a linked list of integers.

Generate an `m x n` matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in **spiral** order (**clockwise**), starting from the **top-left** of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with `-1`.

Return the generated matrix.
