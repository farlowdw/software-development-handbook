You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell in all `4` directions.

Return the number of **strictly increasing** paths in the grid such that you can start from **any** cell and end at **any** cell. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Two paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.
