You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove any **subsequence** of elements of size **exactly** `n` from `nums`. The remaining `2 * n` elements will be divided into two **equal** parts:

- The first `n` elements belonging to the first part and their sum is <code>sum<sub>first</sub></code>.
- The next `n` elements belonging to the second part and their sum is <code>sum<sub>second</sub></code>.

The **difference in sums** of the two parts is denoted as <code>sum<sub>first</sub> - sum<sub>second</sub></code>.

- For example, if <code>sum<sub>first</sub> = 3</code> and <code>sum<sub>second</sub> = 2</code>, their difference is `1`.
- Similarly, if <code>sum<sub>first</sub> = 2</code> and <code>sum<sub>second</sub> = 3</code>, their difference is `-1`.

Return the **minimum difference** possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of `n` elements.
