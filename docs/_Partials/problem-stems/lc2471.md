You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique values**.

In one operation, you can choose any two nodes **at the same level** and swap their values.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a **strictly increasing order**.

The **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
