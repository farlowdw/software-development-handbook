In an election, the `i`th vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time `times[i]`.

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: `TopVotedCandidate.q(int t)` will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t`.  

Votes cast at time `t` will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.
