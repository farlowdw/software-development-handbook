You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where <code>shift[i] = [direction<sub>i</sub>, amount<sub>i</sub>]</code>:

- <code>direction<sub>i</sub></code> can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift).
- <code>amount<sub>i</sub></code> is the amount by which string `s` is to be shifted.
- A left shift by `1` means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.
- Similarly, a right shift by `1` means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.
