Given a string `S` of digits, such as `S = "123456579"`, we can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence `[123, 456, 579]`.

Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list `F` of non-negative integers such that:

- <code>0 &lt;= F[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>, (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit signed integer type);
- `F.length >= 3`;
- and `F[i] + F[i+1] = F[i+2]` for all `0 <= i < F.length - 2`.

Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number `0` itself.

Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from `S`, or return `[]` if it cannot be done.
