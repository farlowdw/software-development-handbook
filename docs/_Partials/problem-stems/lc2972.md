You are given a **0-indexed** array of **positive** integers `nums`.

A subarray of `nums` is called **incremovable** if `nums` becomes **strictly increasing** on removing the subarray. For example, the subarray `[3, 4]` is an incremovable subarray of `[5, 3, 4, 6, 7]` because removing this subarray changes the array `[5, 3, 4, 6, 7]` to `[5, 6, 7]` which is strictly increasing.

Return the total number of **incremovable** subarrays of `nums`.

**Note** that an empty array is considered strictly increasing.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
