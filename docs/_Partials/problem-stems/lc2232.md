You are given a **0-indexed** string `expression` of the form `"<num1>+<num2>"` where `<num1>` and `<num2>` represent positive integers.

Add a pair of parentheses to `expression` such that after the addition of parentheses, `expression` is a **valid** mathematical expression and evaluates to the **smallest** possible value. The left parenthesis **must** be added to the left of `'+'` and the right parenthesis **must** be added to the right of `'+'`.

Return `expression` after adding a pair of parentheses such that `expression` evaluates to the **smallest** possible value. If there are multiple answers that yield the same result, return any of them.

The input has been generated such that the original value of `expression`, and the value of `expression` after adding any pair of parentheses that meets the requirements fits within a signed 32-bit integer.
