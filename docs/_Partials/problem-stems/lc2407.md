You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Find the longest subsequence of `nums` that meets the following requirements:

- The subsequence is **strictly increasing** and
- The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is **at most** `k`.

Return the length of the **longest subsequence** that meets the requirements.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
