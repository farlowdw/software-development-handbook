There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he **refuses to steal from adjacent homes**.

The **capability** of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the `i`th house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least `k` houses.

Return the **minimum** capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least `k` houses.
