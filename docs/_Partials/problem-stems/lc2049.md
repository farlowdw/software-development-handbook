There is a **binary** tree rooted at `0` consisting of `n` nodes. The nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `parents` representing the tree, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parents[0] == -1`.

Each node has a **score**. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were **removed**. The tree would become one or more **non-empty** subtrees. The **size** of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The **score** of the node is the **product of the sizes** of all those subtrees.

Return the **number** of nodes that have the **highest score**.
