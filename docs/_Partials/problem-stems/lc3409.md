You are given an array of integers `nums`.

Your task is to find the length of the **longest** subsequence `seq` of `nums`, such that the **absolute differences** between *consecutive* elements form a **non-increasing sequence** of integers. In other words, for a subsequence <code>seq<sub>0</sub></code>, <code>seq<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>seq<sub>2</sub></code>, ..., <code>seq<sub>m</sub></code> of `nums`, <code>|seq<sub>1</sub> - seq<sub>0</sub>| >= |seq<sub>2</sub> - seq<sub>1</sub>| >= ... >= |seq<sub>m</sub> - seq<sub>m - 1</sub>|</code>.

Return the length of such a subsequence.
