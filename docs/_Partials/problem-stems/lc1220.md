Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed under the following rules:

- Each character is a lower case vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`)
- Each vowel `'a'` may only be followed by an `'e'`.
- Each vowel `'e'` may only be followed by an `'a'` or an `'i'`.
- Each vowel `'i'` **may not** be followed by another `'i'`.
- Each vowel `'o'` may only be followed by an `'i'` or a `'u'`.
- Each vowel `'u'` may only be followed by an `'a'`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
