You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You may partition `nums` into one or more **subsequences** such that each element in `nums` appears in **exactly** one of the subsequences.

Return the **minimum** number of subsequences needed such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subsequence is **at most** `k`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
