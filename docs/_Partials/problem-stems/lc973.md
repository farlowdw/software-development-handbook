Given an array of `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., <code>sqrt((x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)</code>.)

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
