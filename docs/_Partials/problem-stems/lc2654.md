You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisiting of **positive** integers. You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Select an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1` and replace either of `nums[i]` or `nums[i+1]` with their gcd value.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of `nums` equal to `1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.
