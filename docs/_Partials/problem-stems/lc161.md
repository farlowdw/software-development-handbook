Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return `false`.

A string `s` is said to be one distance apart from a string `t` if you can:

- Insert **exactly one** character into `s` to get `t`.
- Delete **exactly one** character from `s` to get `t`.
- Replace **exactly one** character of `s` with **a different character** to get `t`.
