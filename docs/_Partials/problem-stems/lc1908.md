Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with **Alice starting first**.

In this game, there are `n` piles of stones. On each player's turn, the player should remove any **positive** number of stones from a non-empty pile **of his or her choice**. The first player who cannot make a move loses, and the other player wins.

Given an integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` is the number of stones in the `i`th pile, return `true` if Alice wins, or `false` if Bob wins.

Both Alice and Bob play **optimally**.
