A word's **generalized abbreviation** can be constructed by taking any number of non-overlapping substrings and replacing them with their respective lengths. For example, `"abcde"` can be abbreviated into `"a3e"` (`"bcd"` turned into `"3"`), `"1bcd1"` (`"a"` and `"e"` both turned into `"1"`), and `"23"` (`"ab"` turned into `"2"` and `"cde"` turned into `"3"`).

Given a string `word`, return a list of all the possible **generalized abbreviations** of `word`. Return the answer in **any order**.
