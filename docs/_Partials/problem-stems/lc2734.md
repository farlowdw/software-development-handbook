You are given a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can do the following:

- Select any non-empty substring of `s`, possibly the entire string, then replace each one of its characters with the previous character of the English alphabet. For example, `'b'` is converted to `'a'`, and `'a'` is converted to `'z'`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** string you can obtain after performing the above operation **exactly once**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

A string `x` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `y` of the same length if `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order for the first position `i` such that `x[i] != y[i]`.
