You are given a 2D integer array `groups` of length `n`. You are also given an integer array `nums`.

You are asked if you can choose `n` **disjoint** subarrays from the array `nums` such that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> subarray is equal to `groups[i]` **(0-indexed)**, and if `i > 0`, the <code>(i-1)<sup>th</sup></code> subarray appears **before** the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> subarray in `nums` (i.e., the subarrays must be in the same order as `groups`).

Return `true` if you can do this task, and `false` otherwise.

Note that the subarrays are **disjoint** if and only if there is no index `k` such that `nums[k]` belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
