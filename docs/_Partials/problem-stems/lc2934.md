You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both having length `n`.

You are allowed to perform a series of **operations** (**possibly none**).

In an operation, you select an index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and **swap** the values of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`.

Your task is to find the **minimum** number of operations required to satisfy the following conditions:

- `nums1[n - 1]` is equal to the **maximum value** among all elements of `nums1`, i.e., `nums1[n - 1] = max(nums1[0], nums1[1], ..., nums1[n - 1])`.
- `nums2[n - 1]` is equal to the **maximum value** among all elements of `nums2`, i.e., `nums2[n - 1] = max(nums2[0], nums2[1], ..., nums2[n - 1])`.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of operations needed to meet **both** conditions, or `-1` if it is **impossible** to satisfy both conditions.
