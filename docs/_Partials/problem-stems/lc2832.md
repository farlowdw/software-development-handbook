You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of **distinct** integers.

Let us define a **0-indexed** array `ans` of the same length as `nums` in the following way:

- `ans[i]` is the maximum length of a subarray `nums[l..r]`, such that the maximum element in that subarray is equal to `nums[i]`.

Return the array `ans`.

**Note** that a **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.
