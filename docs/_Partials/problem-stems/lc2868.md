Alice and Bob each have a **lexicographically sorted** array of strings named `a` and `b` respectively.

They are playing a wording game with the following rules:

- On each turn, the current player should play a word from their list such that the new word is **closely greater** than the last played word; then it's the other player's turn.
- If a player can't play a word on their turn, they lose.

Alice starts the game by playing her **lexicographically smallest** word.

Given `a` and `b`, return `true` if Alice can win knowing that both players play their best, and `false` otherwise.

A word `w` is **closely greater** than a word `z` if the following conditions are met:

- `w` is **lexicographically greater** than `z`.
- If <code>w<sub>1</sub></code> is the first letter of `w` and <code>z<sub>1</sub></code> is the first letter of `z`, <code>w<sub>1</sub></code> should either be **equal** to <code>z<sub>1</sub></code> or be the **letter after** <code>z<sub>1</sub></code> in the alphabet.
- For example, the word `"care"` is closely greater than `"book"` and `"car"`, but is not closely greater than `"ant"` or `"cook"`.

A string `s` is **lexicographically greater** than a string `t` if in the first position where `s` and `t` differ, string `s` has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `t`. If the first `min(s.length, t.length)` characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically greater one.
