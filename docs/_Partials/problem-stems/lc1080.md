Given the `root` of a binary tree, consider all root to leaf paths: paths from the root to any leaf.  (A leaf is a node with no children.)

A `node` is insufficient if **every** such root to leaf path intersecting this `node` has sum strictly less than `limit`.

Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.
