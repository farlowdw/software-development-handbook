Given the availability time slots arrays `slots1` and `slots2` of two people and a meeting duration `duration`, return the **earliest time slot** that works for both of them and is of duration `duration`.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an **empty array**.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements `[start, end]` representing an inclusive time range from `start` to `end`.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]` of the same person, either `start1 > end2` or `start2 > end1`.
