You are given an integer array `nums`.

Any **positive** divisor of a natural number `x` that is **strictly less** than `x` is called a **proper divisor** of `x`. For example, `2` is a proper divisor of `4`, while `6` is not a proper divisor of `6`.

You are allowed to perform an **operation** any number of times on `nums`, where in each **operation** you select any one element from `nums` and divide it by its **greatest proper divisor**.

Return the **minimum** number of **operations** required to make the array **non-decreasing**.

If it is **not** possible to make the array non-decreasing using any number of operations, return `-1`.
