In this problem, a tree is an **undirected** graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with `N` nodes (with distinct values `1, 2, ..., N`), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `N`, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of edges is a pair `[u, v]` with `u < v`, that represents an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `N` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge `[u, v]` should be in the same format, with `u < v`.
