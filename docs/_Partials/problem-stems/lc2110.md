You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the `i`th day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return the number of **smooth descent period**s.
