Given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, determine whether it is possible to select `k` disjoint special substrings.

A special substring is a substring where:

- Any character present inside the substring should not appear outside it in the string.
- The substring is not the entire string `s`.

Note that all `k` substrings must be disjoint, meaning they cannot overlap.

Return `true` if it is possible to select `k` such disjoint special substrings; otherwise, return `false`.
