Given the `root` of a binary tree and an array of `TreeNode` objects `nodes`, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of **all the nodes** in `nodes`. All the nodes will exist in the tree, and all values of the tree's nodes are **unique**.

Extending the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of `n` nodes <code>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub></code> in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has every <code>p<sub>i</sub></code> as a **descendant** (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**) for every valid `i`". A **descendant** of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.
