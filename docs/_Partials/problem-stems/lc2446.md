You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened **on the same day**, `event1` and `event2`, where:

- <code>event1 = [startTime<sub>1</sub>, endTime<sub>1</sub>]</code> and
- <code>event2 = [startTime<sub>2</sub>, endTime<sub>2</sub>]</code>.

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of `HH:MM`.

A **conflict** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).

Return `true` if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return `false`.
