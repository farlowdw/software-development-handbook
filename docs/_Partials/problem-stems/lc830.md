In a string `s` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like `s = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"`, and `"yy"`.

A group is identified by an interval `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, `"xxxx"` has the interval `[3,6]`.

A group is considered **large** if it has `3` or more characters.

Return the intervals of every **large** group sorted in **increasing order by start index**.
