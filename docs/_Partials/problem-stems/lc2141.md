You have `n` computers. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `batteries` where the `i`th battery can **run** a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running **all** `n` computers **simultaneously** using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert **at most one battery** into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery **any number of times**. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the **maximum** number of minutes you can run all the `n` computers simultaneously.
