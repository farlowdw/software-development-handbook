An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

- `'A'`: Absent.
- `'L'`: Late.
- `'P'`: Present.

Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:

- The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
- The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.

Given an integer `n`, return the **number** of possible attendance records of length `n` that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
