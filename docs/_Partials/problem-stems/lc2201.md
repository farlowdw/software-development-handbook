There is an `n x n` **0-indexed** grid with some artifacts buried in it. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `artifacts` describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where <code>artifacts[i] = [r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>, r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that the `i`th artifact is buried in the subgrid where:

- <code>(r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>)</code> is the coordinate of the **top-left** cell of the `i`th artifact and
- <code>(r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>)</code> is the coordinate of the **bottom-right** cell of the `i`th artifact.

You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.

Given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `dig` where <code>dig[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you will excavate the cell <code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code>, return the number of artifacts that you can extract.

The test cases are generated such that:

- No two artifacts overlap.
- Each artifact only covers at most `4` cells.
- The entries of `dig` are unique.
