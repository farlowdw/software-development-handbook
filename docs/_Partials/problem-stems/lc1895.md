A `k x k` **magic square** is a `k x k` grid filled with integers such that every row sum, every column sum, and both diagonal sums are **all equal**. The integers in the magic square **do not have to be distinct**. Every `1 x 1` grid is trivially a `magic square`.

Given an `m x n` integer `grid`, return the **size** (i.e., the side length `k`) of the **largest magic square** that can be found within this grid.
