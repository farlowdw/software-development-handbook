You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and an integer `k`.

You are to perform the following partitioning operations until `s` is **empty**:

- Choose the **longest prefix** of `s` containing at most `k` **distinct** characters.
- **Delete** the prefix from `s` and increase the number of partitions by one. The remaining characters (if any) in `s` maintain their initial order.

**Before** the operations, you are allowed to change **at most one** index in `s` to another lowercase English letter.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.
