You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can:

- Choose two different indices `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i, j < nums.length`.
- Choose a non-negative integer `k` such that the `k`th bit (**0-indexed**) in the binary representation of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is `1`.
- Subtract <code>2<sup>k</sup></code> from `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

A subarray is **beautiful** if it is possible to make all of its elements equal to `0` after applying the above operation any number of times.

Return the number of **beautiful subarrays** in the array `nums`.

A subarray is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.
