You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`.

You have to check if it is possible to select **two or more** elements in the array such that the bitwise `OR` of the selected elements has **at least** one trailing zero in its binary representation.

For example, the binary representation of `5`, which is `"101"`, does not have any trailing zeros, whereas the binary representation of `4`, which is `"100"`, has two trailing zeros.

Return `true` if it is possible to select two or more elements whose bitwise `OR` has trailing zeros, return `false` otherwise.
