You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

You can perform the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose any two **adjacent** elements and **replace** them with their **sum**.
  + For example, if `nums = [1,2,3,1]`, you can apply one operation to make it `[1,5,1]`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to turn the array into a **palindrome**.
