Given an array `A` (index starts at `1`) consisting of N integers: <code>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>N</sub></code> and an integer `B`. The integer `B` denotes that from any place (suppose the index is `i`) in the array `A`, you can jump to any one of the place in the array `A` indexed `i+1`, `i+2`, …, `i+B` if this place can be jumped to. Also, if you step on the index `i`, you have to pay <code>A<sub>i</sub></code> coins. If <code>A<sub>i</sub></code> is `-1`, it means you can't jump to the place indexed `i` in the array.

Now, you start from the place indexed `1` in the array `A`, and your aim is to reach the place indexed `N` using the minimum coins. You need to return the path of indexes (starting from `1` to `N`) in the array you should take to get to the place indexed `N` using minimum coins.

If there are multiple paths with the same cost, return the lexicographically smallest such path.

If it's not possible to reach the place indexed N then you need to return an empty array.
