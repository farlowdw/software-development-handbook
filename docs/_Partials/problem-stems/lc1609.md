A binary tree is named **Even-Odd** if it meets the following conditions:

- The root of the binary tree is at level index `0`, its children are at level index `1`, their children are at level index `2`, etc.
- For every **even-indexed** level, all nodes at the level have **odd** integer values in **strictly increasing** order (from left to right).
- For every **odd-indexed** level, all nodes at the level have **even** integer values in **strictly decreasing** order (from left to right).

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return `true` if the binary tree is **Even-Odd**, otherwise return `false`.
