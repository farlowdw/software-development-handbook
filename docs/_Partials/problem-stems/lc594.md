We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
