Given a list of **non-overlapping** axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, write a function `pick` which randomly and uniformily picks an **integer point** in the space covered by the rectangles.

**Note:**

1. An **integer point** is a point that has integer coordinates. 
2. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is **included** in the space covered by the rectangles. 
3. <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> rectangle = `rects[i]` = `[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, where `[x1, y1]` are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `[x2, y2]` are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
4. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed `2000`.
5. `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
6. `pick` return a point as an array of integer coordinates `[p_x, p_y]`
7. `pick` is called at most `10000` times.
