You are given an integer `mass`, which represents the original mass of a planet. You are further given an integer array `asteroids`, where `asteroids[i]` is the mass of the `i`th asteroid.

You can arrange for the planet to collide with the asteroids in **any arbitrary order**. If the mass of the planet is **greater than or equal to** the mass of the asteroid, the asteroid is **destroyed** and the planet **gains** the mass of the asteroid. Otherwise, the planet is destroyed.

Return `true` if **all** asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return `false`.
