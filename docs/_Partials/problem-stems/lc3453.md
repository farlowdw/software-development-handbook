You are given a 2D integer array `squares`. Each <code>squares[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, l<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.

Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area of the squares above the line equals the total area of the squares below the line.

Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Note:** Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted multiple times.
