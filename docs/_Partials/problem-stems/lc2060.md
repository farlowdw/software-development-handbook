An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:

- Arbitrarily **split** it into a **sequence** of some number of **non-empty** substrings.
- Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and **replace** each with **its length** (as a numeric string).
- **Concatenate** the sequence as the encoded string.

For example, **one way** to encode an original string `"abcdefghijklmnop"` might be:

- Split it as a sequence: `["ab", "cdefghijklmn", "o", "p"]`.
- Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes `["ab", "12", "1", "p"]`.
- Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: `"ab121p"`.

Given two encoded strings `s1` and `s2`, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits `1-9` (inclusive), return `true` if there exists an original string that could be encoded as **both** `s1` and `s2`. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Note:** The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in `s1` and `s2` does not exceed `3`.
