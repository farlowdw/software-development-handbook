Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

1. The code must be wrapped in a **valid closed tag**. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
2. A **closed tag** (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The `TAG_NAME` in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is **valid** if and only if the `TAG_NAME` and `TAG_CONTENT` are valid.
3. A **valid** `TAG_NAME` only contain **upper-case letters**, and has length in range `[1,9]`. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is **invalid**.
4. A **valid** `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other **valid closed tags**, **cdata** and any characters (see note1) **EXCEPT** unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid `TAG_NAME`. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is **invalid**.
5. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same `TAG_NAME`, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
6. A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as `TAG_NAME` (not necessarily valid).
7. The cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the **first subsequent** `]]>`.
8. `CDATA_CONTENT` may contain **any characters**. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as **regular characters**.
