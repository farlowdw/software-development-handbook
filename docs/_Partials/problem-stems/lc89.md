An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of <code>2<sup>n</sup></code> integers where:

- Every integer is in the **inclusive** range <code>[0, 2<sup>n</sup> - 1]</code>,
- The first integer is `0`,
- An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**, and
- The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return any valid **n-bit gray code sequence**.
