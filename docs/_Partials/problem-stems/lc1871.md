You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the beginning, you are standing at index `0`, which is equal to `'0'`. You can move from index `i` to index `j` if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- `i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1)`, and
- `s[j] == '0'`.

Return `true` if you can reach index `s.length - 1` in `s`, or `false` otherwise.
