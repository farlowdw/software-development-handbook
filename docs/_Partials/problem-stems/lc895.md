Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:

- `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
- `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
  + If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.
