In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door.

Given a string `ring`, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key`, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the **minimum** number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the `ring` is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string `key` one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string `key` aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1. You can rotate the `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise **one place**, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string `ring`'s characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character `key[i]`.
2. If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.
