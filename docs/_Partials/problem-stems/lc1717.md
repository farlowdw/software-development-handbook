You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

- Remove substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points.
  + For example, when removing `"ab"` from <code>"c<u>ab</u>xbae"</code> it becomes `"cxbae"`.
- Remove substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points.
  + For example, when removing `"ba"` from <code>"cabx<u>ba</u>e"</code> it becomes `"cabxe"`.

Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on `s`.
