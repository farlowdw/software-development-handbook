Given a **0-indexed** string `s`, repeatedly perform the following operation **any** number of times:

- Choose an index `i` in the string, and let `c` be the character in position `i`. **Delete** the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **left** of `i` (if any) and the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **right** of `i` (if any).

Your task is to **minimize** the length of `s` by performing the above operation any number of times.

Return an integer denoting the length of the **minimized** string.
