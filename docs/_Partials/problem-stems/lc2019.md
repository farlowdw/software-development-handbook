You are given a string `s` that contains digits `0-9`, addition symbols `'+'`, and multiplication symbols `'*'` **only**, representing a **valid** math expression of **single digit numbers** (e.g., `3+5*2`). This expression was given to `n` elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this **order of operations**:

1. Compute **multiplication**, reading from **left to right**; Then,
2. Compute **addition**, reading from **left to right**.

You are given an integer array `answers` of length `n`, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the `answers`, by following these **rules**:

- If an answer **equals** the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded `5` points;
- Otherwise, if the answer **could be interpreted** as if the student used the **incorrect order of operations, once** or **multiple** times, this student will be rewarded `2` points;
- Otherwise, this student will be rewarded `0` points.

Return the sum of the points of the students.
