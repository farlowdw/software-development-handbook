You are given an array of integers `distance`.

You start at point `(0,0)` on an **X-Y** plane and you move `distance[0]` meters to the north, then `distance[1]` meters to the west, `distance[2]` meters to the south, `distance[3]` meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Return `true` if your path crosses itself, and `false` if it does not.
