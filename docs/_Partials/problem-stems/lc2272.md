The **variance** of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of **any** `2` characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the **largest variance** possible among all **substrings** of `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
