You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.

You have to perform `m` **independent** queries on the tree where in the `i`th query you do the following:

- **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is **guaranteed** that `queries[i]` will **not** be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array `answer` of size `m` where `answer[i]` is the height of the tree after performing the `i`th query.

**Note:**

- The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.
- The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.
