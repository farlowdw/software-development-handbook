An encoded string `S` is given.  To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read **one character at a time** and the following steps are taken:

- If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
- If the character read is a digit (say `d`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written d-1 more times in total.

Now for some encoded string `S`, and an index `K`, find and return the `K`th letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.
