Given a non-empty 2D array grid of `0`'s and `1`'s, an **island** is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of **distinct** islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after **rotation** (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or **reflection** (left/right direction or up/down direction).
