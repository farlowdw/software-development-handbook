You are given a positive integer array `skill` of **even** length `n` where `skill[i]` denotes the skill of the `i`th player. Divide the players into `n / 2` teams of size `2` such that the total skill of each team is **equal**.

The **chemistry** of a team is equal to the **product** of the skills of the players on that team.

Return the sum of the **chemistry** of all the teams, or return `-1` if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.
