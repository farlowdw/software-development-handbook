You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, of the same length.

An index `i` is considered **matching** if `nums1[i] == nums2[i]`.

Return the **maximum** number of **matching** indices after performing any number of **right shifts** on `nums1`.

A **right shift** is defined as shifting the element at index `i` to index `(i + 1) % n`, for all indices.
