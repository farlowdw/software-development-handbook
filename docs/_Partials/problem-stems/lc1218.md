Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
