You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` having an even length.

A string is **beautiful** if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

- Each substring has an **even length**.
- Each substring contains **only** `1`'s or only `0`'s.

You can change any character in `s` to `0` or `1`.

Return the **minimum** number of changes required to make the string `s` beautiful.
