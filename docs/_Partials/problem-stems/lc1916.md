You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room `prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected **directly**. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room `0`.

You can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room** is already built.

Return the **number of different orders** you can build all the rooms in. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
