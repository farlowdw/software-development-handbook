There is a **simple directed graph** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph would form a **tree** if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer `n` and a **2D** integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a **directed edge** going from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

An **edge reversal** changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> becomes a directed edge going from node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code>.

For every node `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, your task is to **independently** calculate the **minimum** number of **edge reversals** required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a **sequence** of **directed edges**.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** number of **edge reversals** required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a **sequence** of **directed edges**.
