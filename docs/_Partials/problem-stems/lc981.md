Create a timebased key-value store class `TimeMap`, that supports two operations.

1. `set(string key, string value, int timestamp)`

- Stores the `key` and `value`, along with the given `timestamp`.

2. `get(string key, int timestamp)`

- Returns a value such that `set(key, value, timestamp_prev)` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`.
- If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest `timestamp_prev`.
- If there are no values, it returns the empty string (`""`).
