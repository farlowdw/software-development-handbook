You are given three **positive** integers `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.

The `key` of `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` is defined as a four-digit number such that:

- Initially, if any number has **less than** four digits, it is padded with **leading zeros**.
- The `i`th digit (`1 <= i <= 4`) of the `key` is generated by taking the **smallest** digit among the `i`th digits of `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.

Return the `key` of the three numbers **without** leading zeros (if any).
