You have information about `n` different recipes. You are given a string array `recipes` and a 2D string array `ingredients`. The `i`th recipe has the name `recipes[i]`, and you can **create** it if you have **all** the needed ingredients from `ingredients[i]`. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from **other** recipes, i.e., `ingredients[i]` may contain a string that is in `recipes`.

You are also given a string array `supplies` containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.
