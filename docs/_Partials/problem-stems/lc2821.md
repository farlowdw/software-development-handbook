Given an array `functions` and a number `ms`, return a new array of functions.

- `functions` is an array of functions that return promises.
- `ms` represents the delay duration in milliseconds. It determines the amount of time to wait before resolving each promise in the new array.

Each function in the new array should return a promise that resolves after a delay of `ms` milliseconds, preserving the order of the original `functions` array. The `delayAll` function should ensure that each promise from `functions` is executed with a delay, forming the new array of functions returning delayed promises.
