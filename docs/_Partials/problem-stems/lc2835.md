You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of **non-negative** powers of `2`, and an integer `target`.

In one operation, you must apply the following changes to the array:

- Choose any element of the array `nums[i]` such that `nums[i] > 1`.
- Remove `nums[i]` from the array.
- Add **two** occurrences of `nums[i] / 2` to the **end** of `nums`.

Return the **minimum number of operations** you need to perform so that `nums` contains a **subsequence** whose elements sum to `target`. If it is impossible to obtain such a subsequence, return `-1`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
