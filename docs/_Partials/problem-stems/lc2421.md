There is a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where `vals[i]` denotes the value of the `i`th node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

A **good path** is a simple path that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The starting node and the ending node have the **same** value.
2. All nodes between the starting node and the ending node have values **less than or equal to** the starting node (i.e. the starting node's value should be the maximum value along the path).

Return the number of distinct good paths.

Note that a path and its reverse are counted as the **same** path. For example, `0 -> 1` is considered to be the same as `1 -> 0`. A single node is also considered as a valid path.
