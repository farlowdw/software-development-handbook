Given a `time` represented in the format `"HH:MM"`, form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, `"01:34"`, `"12:09"` are all valid. `"1:34"`, `"12:9"` are all invalid.
