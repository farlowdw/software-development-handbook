Given the `root` of a binary tree and a `leaf` node, reroot the tree so that the `leaf` is the new root.

You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path **starting from the** `leaf` up to the `root` **excluding the root**:

1. If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child.
2. `cur`'s original parent becomes cur's left child. Note that in this process the original parent's pointer to `cur` becomes `null`, making it have at most one child.

Return the new root of the rerooted tree.

**Note:** Ensure that your solution sets the `Node.parent` pointers correctly after rerooting or you will receive "Wrong Answer".
