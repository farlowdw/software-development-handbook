You are given two **positive** integers `n` and `k`.

An integer `x` is called **k-palindromic** if:

- `x` is a palindrome.
- `x` is divisible by `k`.

Return the **largest** integer having `n` digits (as a string) that is **k-palindromic**.

**Note** that the integer must **not** have leading zeros.
