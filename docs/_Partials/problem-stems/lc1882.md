You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. `servers[i]` is the **weight** of the `i`th server, and `tasks[j]` is the **time needed** to process the `j`th task **in seconds**.

You are running a simulation system that will shut down after all tasks are processed. Each server can only process one task at a time. You will be able to process the `j`th task starting from the `j`th second beginning with the `0`th task at second `0`. To process task `j`, you assign it to the server with the **smallest weight** that is free, and in case of a tie, choose the server with the **smallest index**. If a free server gets assigned task `j` at second `t`, it will be free again at the second `t + tasks[j]`.

If there are no free servers, you must wait until one is free and execute the free tasks **as soon as possible**. If **multiple** tasks need to be assigned, assign them in order of **increasing index**.

You may assign multiple tasks at the same second if there are multiple free servers.

Build an array `ans` of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the **index** of the server the `j`th task will be assigned to.

Return the array `ans`.
