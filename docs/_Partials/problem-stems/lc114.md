Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a [pre-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR) of the binary tree.
