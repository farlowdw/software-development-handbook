You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `i`th student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return the **minimum** possible difference.
