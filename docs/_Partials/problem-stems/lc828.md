Let's define a function `countUniqueChars(s)` that returns the number of unique characters on `s`, for example if `s = "LEETCODE"` then `"L"`, `"T"`,`"C"`, `"O"`, `"D"` are the unique characters since they appear only once in `s`, therefore `countUniqueChars(s) = 5`.

On this problem given a string `s` we need to return the sum of `countUniqueChars(t)` where `t` is a substring of `s`. Notice that some substrings can be repeated so on this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
