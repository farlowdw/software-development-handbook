You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.

A string `x` is called **valid** if `x` can be rearranged to have `word2` as a prefix.

Return the total number of **valid** substrings of `word1`.

**Note** that the memory limits in this problem are **smaller** than usual, so you **must** implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity.
