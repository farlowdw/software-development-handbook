Design a [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) that is played on a device with screen size `height x width`. [Play the game online](http://patorjk.com/games/snake/) if you are not familiar with the game.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner `(0, 0)` with a length of `1` unit.

You are given an array `food` where <code>food[i] = (r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code> is the row and column position of a piece of food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score both increase by `1`.

Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear until the snake eats the first piece of food.

When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is **guaranteed** that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.

The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds (hits a wall) or if its head occupies a space that its body occupies **after** moving (i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself).

Implement the `SnakeGame` class:

- `SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food)` Initializes the object with a screen of size `height x width` and the positions of the `food`.
- `int move(String direction)` Returns the score of the game after applying one `direction` move by the snake. If the game is over, return `-1`.
