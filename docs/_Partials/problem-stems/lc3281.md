You are given an array of integers `start` and an integer `d`, representing `n` intervals `[start[i], start[i] + d]`.

You are asked to choose `n` integers where the `i`th integer must belong to the `i`th interval. The **score** of the chosen integers is defined as the **minimum** absolute difference between any two integers that have been chosen.

Return the **maximum** possible score of the chosen integers.
