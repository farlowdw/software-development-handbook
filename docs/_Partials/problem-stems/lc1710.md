You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array <code>boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub>, numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub>]</code>:

- <code>numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub></code> is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- <code>numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub></code> is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck.
