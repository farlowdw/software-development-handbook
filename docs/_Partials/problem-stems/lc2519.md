You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

We call an index `i` **k-big** if the following conditions are satisfied:

- There exist at least `k` different indices `idx1` such that `idx1 < i` and `nums[idx1] < nums[i]`.
- There exist at least `k` different indices `idx2` such that `idx2 > i` and `nums[idx2] < nums[i]`.

Return the number of `k`-big indices.
