CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS

INSERT INTO
  Weather
VALUES
  ('1', '2015-01-01', '10'),

**Table:** `Weather`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the primary key for this table
- This table contains information about the temperature in a certain day.

Write an SQL query to find all dates' `id` with higher temperature compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Weather
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | Temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
```

- In `2015-01-02`, temperature was higher than the previous day (`10 -> 25`).
- In `2015-01-04`, temperature was higher than the previous day (`20 -> 30`).
