You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `cost` and `time`, of size `n` representing the costs and the time taken to paint `n` different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

- A **paid painter** that paints the `i`th wall in `time[i]` units of time and takes `cost[i]` units of money.
- A **free painter** that paints **any** wall in `1` unit of time at a cost of `0`. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already **occupied**.

Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the `n` walls.
