You are given a string `word` and an integer `k`.

We consider `word` to be **k-special** if `|freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k` for all indices `i` and `j` in the string.

Here, `freq(x)` denotes the frequency of the character `x` in `word`, and `|y|` denotes the absolute value of `y`.

Return the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make `word` **k-special**.
