You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

Return **any** such subsequence as an integer array of length `k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
