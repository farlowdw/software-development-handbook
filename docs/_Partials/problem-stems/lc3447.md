You are given an integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` represents the size of the `i`th group. You are also given an integer array `elements`.

Your task is to assign **one** element to each group based on the following rules:

- An element `j` can be assigned to a group `i` if `groups[i]` is divisible by `elements[j]`.
- If there are multiple elements that can be assigned, assign the element with the smallest index `j`.
- If no element satisfies the condition for a group, assign `-1` to that group.

Return an integer array assigned, where `assigned[i]` is the index of the element chosen for group `i`, or `-1` if no suitable element exists.

**Note:** An element may be assigned to more than one group.
