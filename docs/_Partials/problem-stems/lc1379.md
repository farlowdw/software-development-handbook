Given two binary trees `original` and `cloned` and given a reference to a node `target` in the original tree.

The `cloned` tree is a **copy of** the `original` tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the `cloned` tree.

**Note** that you are **not allowed** to change any of the two trees or the `target` node and the answer **must be** a reference to a node in the `cloned` tree.

**Follow up:** Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.
