With respect to a given `puzzle` string, a `word` is valid if both the following conditions are satisfied:

- `word` contains the first letter of `puzzle`.
- For each letter in `word`, that letter is in `puzzle`. For example, if the `puzzle` is `"abcdefg"`, then valid words are `"faced"`, `"cabbage"`, and `"baggage"`; while invalid words are `"beefed"` (doesn't include `"a"`) and `"based"` (includes `"s"` which isn't in the puzzle).

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of words in the given word list `words` that are valid with respect to the puzzle `puzzles[i]`.
