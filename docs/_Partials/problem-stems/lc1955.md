A sequence is **special** if it consists of a **positive** number of `0`s, followed by a **positive** number of `1`s, then a **positive** number of `2`s.

- For example, `[0,1,2]` and `[0,0,1,1,1,2]` are special.
- In contrast, `[2,1,0]`, `[1]`, and `[0,1,2,0]` are not special.

Given an array `nums` (consisting of **only** integers `0`, `1`, and `2`), return the **number of different subsequences** that are special. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are **different** if the **set of indices** chosen are different.
