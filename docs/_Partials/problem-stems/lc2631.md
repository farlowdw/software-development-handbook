Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the `array.groupBy(fn)` method on any array and it will return a **grouped** version of the array.

A **grouped** array is an object where each key is the output of `fn(arr[i])` and each value is an array containing all items in the original array with that key.

The provided callback `fn` will accept an item in the array and return a string key.

The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

Please solve it without lodash's `_.groupBy` function.
