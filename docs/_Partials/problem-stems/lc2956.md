You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of sizes `n` and `m`, respectively.

Consider calculating the following values:

- The number of indices `i` such that `0 <= i < n` and `nums1[i]` occurs **at least** once in `nums2`.
- The number of indices `i` such that `0 <= i < m` and `nums2[i]` occurs **at least** once in `nums1`.

Return an integer array `answer` of size `2` containing the two values **in the above order**.
