You are given a binary array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose **any** 3 **consecutive** elements from the array and **flip all** of them.

**Flipping** an element means changing its value from `0` to `1`, and from `1` to `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` equal to `1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.
