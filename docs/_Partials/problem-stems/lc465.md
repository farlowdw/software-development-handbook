A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for `$10`. Then later Chris gave Alice `$5` for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple `(x, y, z)` which means person `x` gave person `y` `$z`. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively (`0`, `1`, `2` are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as `[[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]`.

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

**Note:**

1. A transaction will be given as a tuple `(x, y, z)`. Note that `x â‰  y` and `z > 0`.
2. Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons `0`, `1`, `2` or we could also have the persons `0`, `2`, `6`.
