You are given a 2D array of strings `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where <code>equations[i] = [A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>]</code> and `values[i]` means that <code>A<sub>i</sub> / B<sub>i</sub> = values[i]</code>.

Determine if there exists a contradiction in the equations. Return `true` if there is a contradiction, or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** When checking if two numbers are equal, check that their **absolute difference** is less than <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code>.
