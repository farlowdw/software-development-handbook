Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.
