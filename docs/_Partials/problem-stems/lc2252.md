DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  Products (product_id int, store varchar(10), price int);

INSERT INTO
  Products (product_id, store, price)
VALUES
  ('1', 'Shop', '110'),
  ('1', 'LC_Store', '100'),

**Table:** `Products`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store       | varchar |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `(product_id, store)` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the price of `product_id` in store.
- There will be at most 30 different stores in the table.
- `price` is the price of the product at this store.

**Important note:** This problem targets those who have a good experience with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.

Implement the procedure `PivotProducts` to reorganize the `Products` table so that each row has the id of one product and its price in each store. The price should be `null` if the product is not sold in a store. The columns of the table should contain each store and they should be sorted in **lexicographical order**.

The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
