You are given two integers `m` and `n`. Consider an `m x n` grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell **red**, **green**, or **blue**. All cells **must** be painted.

Return the number of ways to color the grid with **no two adjacent cells having the same color**. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
