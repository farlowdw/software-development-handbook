You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to find a subarray of `nums` such that the **absolute difference** between `k` and the bitwise `OR` of the subarray elements is as **small** as possible. In other words, select a subarray `nums[l..r]` such that `|k - (nums[l] OR nums[l + 1] ... OR nums[r])|` is minimum.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the absolute difference.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.
