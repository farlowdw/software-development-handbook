You are given an array of strings `words` (**0-indexed**).

In one operation, pick two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, where `words[i]` is a non-empty string, and move **any** character from `words[i]` to **any** position in `words[j]`.

Return `true` if you can make **every** string in `words` **equal** using **any** number of operations, and `false` otherwise.
