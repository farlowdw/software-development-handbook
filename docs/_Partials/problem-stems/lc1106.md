Return the result of evaluating a given boolean `expression`, represented as a string.

An expression can either be:

- `"t"`, evaluating to `True`;
- `"f"`, evaluating to `False`;
- `"!(expr)"`, evaluating to the logical NOT of the inner expression `expr`;
- `"&(expr1,expr2,...)"`, evaluating to the logical AND of 2 or more inner expressions `expr1, expr2, ...`;
- `"|(expr1,expr2,...)"`, evaluating to the logical OR of 2 or more inner expressions `expr1, expr2, ...`
