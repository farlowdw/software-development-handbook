Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.

A value `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|` where `m` is the **median** of the array.

If `|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|`, then `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than `arr[j]` if `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

Return a list of the strongest `k` values in the array. return the answer **in any arbitrary order**.

**Median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is `n`, the median is the element in position `((n - 1) / 2)` in the sorted list (**0-indexed**).

- For `arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11]`, `n = 5` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2`. The median is `6`.
- For `arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3]`, `n = 4` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1`. The median is `3`.
