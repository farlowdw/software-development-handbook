You are given an array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function `pickIndex()` which randomly returns an integer in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`. `pickIndex()` should return the integer proportional to its weight in the `w` array. For example, for `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking the index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.
