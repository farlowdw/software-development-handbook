Given the array `queries` of positive integers between `1` and `m`, you have to process all `queries[i]` (from `i=0` to `i=queries.length-1`) according to the following rules:

- In the beginning, you have the permutation `P=[1,2,3,...,m]`.
- For the current `i`, find the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P` (**indexing from 0**) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation `P`. Notice that the position of `queries[i]` in `P` is the result for `queries[i]`.

Return an array containing the result for the given `queries`.
