Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

```
    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].
```

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

</p>

```
File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file
```

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

```
    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[].
```

**Note:**

- Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
- The read function may be **called multiple times**.
- Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002895993-Technical-Questions) for more details.
- You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
- It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.
