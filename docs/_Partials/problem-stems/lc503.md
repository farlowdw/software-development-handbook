Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return the **next greater number** for every element in `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.
