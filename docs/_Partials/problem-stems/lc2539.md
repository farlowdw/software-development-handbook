A **subsequence** of a string is good if it is not empty and the frequency of each one of its characters is the same.

Given a string `s`, return the number of good subsequences of `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
