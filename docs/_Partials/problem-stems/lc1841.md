**Table:** `Teams`

```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| team_id        | int     |
| team_name      | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
```

- `team_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains information about one team in the league.

**Table:** `Matches`

```
+-----------------+---------+
| Column Name     | Type    |
+-----------------+---------+
| home_team_id    | int     |
| away_team_id    | int     |
| home_team_goals | int     |
| away_team_goals | int     |
+-----------------+---------+
```

- `(home_team_id, away_team_id)` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains information about one match.
- `home_team_goals` is the number of goals scored by the home team.
- `away_team_goals` is the number of goals scored by the away team.
- The winner of the match is the team with the higher number of goals.

Write an SQL query to report the statistics of the league. The statistics should be built using the played matches where the **winning** team gets **three points** and the **losing** team gets **no points**. If a match ends with a **draw**, both teams get **one point**.

Each row of the result table should contain:

- `team_name` - The name of the team in the `Teams` table.
- `matches_played` - The number of matches played as either a home or away team.
- `points` - The total points the team has so far.
- `goal_for` - The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.
- `goal_against` - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against this team across all matches.
- `goal_diff` - The result of `goal_for - goal_against`.

Return the result table **in descending order by** `points`. If two or more teams have the same `points`, order them **in descending order by** `goal_diff`. If there is still a tie, order them by `team_name` in **lexicographical order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Teams table:
+---------+-----------+
| team_id | team_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 1       | Ajax      |
| 4       | Dortmund  |
| 6       | Arsenal   |
+---------+-----------+

Matches table:
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |
| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |
| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |
| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+


Result table:
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |
| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |
| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
```

- Ajax (`team_id=1`) played `4` matches: `2` losses and `2` draws. Total points `= 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.
- Dortmund (`team_id=4`) played `2` matches: `2` wins. Total points `= 3 + 3 = 6`.
- Arsenal (`team_id=6`) played `2` matches: `2` draws. Total points `= 1 + 1 = 2`.

Dortmund is the first team in the table. Ajax and Arsenal have the same points, but since Arsenal has a higher `goal_diff` than Ajax, Arsenal comes before Ajax in the table.
