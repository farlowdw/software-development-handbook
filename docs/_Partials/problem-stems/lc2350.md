You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You roll a `k` sided dice numbered from `1` to `k`, `n` times, where the result of the `i`th roll is `rolls[i]`.

Return the length of the **shortest** sequence of rolls that **cannot** be taken from `rolls`.

A **sequence of rolls** of length `len` is the result of rolling a `k` sided dice `len` times.

**Note** that the sequence taken does not have to be consecutive as long as it is in order.
