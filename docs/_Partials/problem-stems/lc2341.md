You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, you may do the following:

- Choose two integers in `nums` that are **equal**.
- Remove both integers from `nums`, forming a **pair**.

The operation is done on `nums` as many times as possible.

Return a **0-indexed** integer array `answer` of size `2` where `answer[0]` is the number of pairs that are formed and `answer[1]` is the number of leftover integers in `nums` after doing the operation as many times as possible.
