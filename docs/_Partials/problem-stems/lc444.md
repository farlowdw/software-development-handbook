Check whether the original sequence `org` can be uniquely reconstructed from the sequences in `seqs`. The `org` sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with <code>1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>4</sup></code>. Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the sequences in `seqs` (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in `seqs` are subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from `seqs` and it is the `org` sequence.
