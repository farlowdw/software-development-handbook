You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` specialty retail stores. There are `m` product types of varying amounts, which are given as a **0-indexed** integer array `quantities`, where `quantities[i]` represents the number of products of the `i`th product type.

You need to distribute **all products** to the retail stores following these rules:

- A store can only be given **at most one product type** but can be given **any** amount of it.
- After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly `0`). Let `x` represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want `x` to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to **minimize** the **maximum** number of products that are given to any store.
Return the minimum possible `x`.
