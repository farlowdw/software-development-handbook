You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where <code>questions[i] = [points<sub>i</sub>, brainpower<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you <code>points<sub>i</sub></code> points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next <code>brainpower<sub>i</sub></code> questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

- For example, given `questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:
  + If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
  + If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.

Return the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam.
