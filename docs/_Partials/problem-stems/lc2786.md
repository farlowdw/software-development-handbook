You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `x`.

You are **initially** at position `0` in the array and you can visit other positions according to the following rules:

- If you are currently in position `i`, then you can move to **any** position `j` such that `i < j`.
- For each position `i` that you visit, you get a score of `nums[i]`.
- If you move from a position `i` to a position `j` and the **parities** of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` differ, then you lose a score of `x`.

Return the **maximum** total score you can get.

**Note** that initially you have `nums[0]` points.
