A password is said to be **strong** if it satisfies all the following criteria:

- It has at least `8` characters.
- It contains at least **one lowercase** letter.
- It contains at least **one uppercase** letter.
- It contains at least **one digit**.
- It contains at least **one special character**. The special characters are the characters in the following string: `"!@#$%^&*()-+"`.
- It does **not** contain `2` of the same character in adjacent positions (i.e., `"aab"` violates this condition, but `"aba"` does not).

Given a string `password`, return `true` if it is a **strong** password. Otherwise, return `false`.
