You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` having length `n`, an integer `indexDifference`, and an integer `valueDifference`.

Your task is to find **two** indices `i` and `j`, both in the range `[0, n - 1]`, that satisfy the following conditions:

- `abs(i - j) >= indexDifference`, and
- `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference`

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer = [i, j]` if there are two such indices, and `answer = [-1, -1]` otherwise. If there are multiple choices for the two indices, return any of them.

**Note:** `i` and `j` may be **equal**.
