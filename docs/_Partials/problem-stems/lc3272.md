You are given two **positive** integers `n` and `k`.

An integer `x` is called **k-palindromic** if:

- `x` is a palindrome.
- `x` is divisible by `k`.

An integer is called **good** if its digits can be rearranged to form a **k-palindromic** integer. For example, for `k = 2`, `2020` can be rearranged to form the k-palindromic integer `2002`, whereas `1010` cannot be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer.

Return the count of **good** integers containing `n` digits.

**Note** that any integer must **not** have leading zeros, **neither** before **nor** after rearrangement. For example, `1010` cannot be rearranged to form `101`.
