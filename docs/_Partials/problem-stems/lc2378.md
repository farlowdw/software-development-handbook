You are given a **weighted** tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

The tree is **rooted** at node `0` and represented with a **2D** array `edges` of size `n` where <code>edges[i] = [par<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that node <code>par<sub>i</sub></code> is the **parent** of node `i`, and the edge between them has a weight equal to <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>. Since the root does **not** have a parent, you have `edges[0] = [-1, -1]`.

Choose some edges from the tree such that no two chosen edges are **adjacent** and the **sum** of the weights of the chosen edges is maximized.

Return the **maximum** sum of the chosen edges.

**Note:**

- You are allowed to **not** choose any edges in the tree, the sum of weights in this case will be `0`.
- Two edges <code>Edge<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>Edge<sub>2</sub></code> in the tree are adjacent if they have a common node.

In other words, they are adjacent if <code>Edge<sub>1</sub></code> connects nodes `a` and `b` and <code>Edge<sub>2</sub></code> connects nodes `b` and `c`.
