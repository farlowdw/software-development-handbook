Given a binary string `s`, return the **minimum** number of character swaps to make it **alternating**, or `-1` if it is impossible.

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Any two characters may be swapped, even if they are **not adjacent**.
