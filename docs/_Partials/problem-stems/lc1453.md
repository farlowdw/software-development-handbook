You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of `points` on a 2D plane. 

Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on **any** circular dartboard of radius `r`.
