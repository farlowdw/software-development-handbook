You are given a very large integer `n`, represented as a string, and an integer digit `x`. The digits in `n` and the digit `x` are in the **inclusive** range `[1, 9]`, and `n` may represent a **negative** number.

You want to **maximize `n`'s numerical value** by inserting `x` anywhere in the decimal representation of `n`. You **cannot** insert `x` to the left of the negative sign.

- For example, if `n = 73` and `x = 6`, it would be best to insert it between `7` and `3`, making `n = 763`.
- If `n = -55` and `x = 2`, it would be best to insert it before the first `5`, making `n = -255`.

Return a string representing the **maximum** value of `n` after the insertion.
