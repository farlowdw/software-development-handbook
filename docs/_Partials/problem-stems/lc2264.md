You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. An integer is **good** if it meets the following conditions:

- It is a **substring** of `num` with length `3`.
- It consists of only one unique digit.

Return the **maximum good** integer as a **string** or an empty string `""` if no such integer exists.

Note:

- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- There may be **leading zeroes** in `num` or a good integer.
