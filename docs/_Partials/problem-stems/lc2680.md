You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. In an operation, you can choose an element and multiply it by `2`.

Return the maximum possible value of `nums[0] | nums[1] | ... | nums[n - 1]` that can be obtained after applying the operation on nums at most `k` times.

Note that `a | b` denotes the **bitwise or** between two integers `a` and `b`.
