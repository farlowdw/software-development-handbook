You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

A **k-subsequence** is a **subsequence** of `s`, having length `k`, and all its characters are **unique**, i.e., every character occurs once.

Let `f(c)` denote the number of times the character `c` occurs in `s`.

The **beauty** of a **k-subsequence** is the **sum** of `f(c)` for every character `c` in the k-subsequence.

For example, consider `s = "abbbdd"` and `k = 2`:

- `f('a') = 1, f('b') = 3, f('d') = 2`
- Some k-subsequences of `s` are:
  + <code>"<b><u>ab</u></b>bbd"</code> -> <code>"ab"</code> having a beauty of <code>f('a') + f('b') = 4</code>
  + <code>"<b><u>a</u></b>bbb<b><u>d</u></b>d"</code> -> <code>"ad"</code> having a beauty of <code>f('a') + f('d') = 3</code>
  + <code>"a<b><u>b</u></b>bb<b><u>d</u></b>d"</code> -> <code>"bd"</code> having a beauty of <code>f('b') + f('d') = 5</code>

Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose **beauty** is the **maximum** among all **k-subsequences**. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

**Notes**

- `f(c)` is the number of times a character `c` occurs in `s`, not a k-subsequence.
- Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.
