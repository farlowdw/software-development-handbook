A zero-indexed array `A` of length `N` contains all integers from `0` to `N-1`. Find and return the longest length of set `S`, where `S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... }` subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in `S` starts with the selection of element `A[i]` of `index = i`, the next element in `S` should be `A[A[i]]`, and then `A[A[A[i]]]â€¦` By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in `S`.
