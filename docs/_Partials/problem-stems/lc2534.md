There are `n` persons numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and a door. Each person can enter or exit through the door once, taking one second.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `arrival` of size `n`, where `arrival[i]` is the arrival time of the `i`th person at the door. You are also given an array `state` of size `n`, where `state[i]` is `0` if person `i` wants to enter through the door or `1` if they want to exit through the door.

If two or more persons want to use the door at the **same** time, they follow the following rules:

- If the door was **not** used in the previous second, then the person who wants to **exit** goes first.
- If the door was used in the previous second for **entering**, the person who wants to enter goes first.
- If the door was used in the previous second for **exiting**, the person who wants to **exit** goes first.
- If multiple persons want to go in the same direction, the person with the **smallest** index goes first.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the second at which the `i`th person crosses the door.

**Note** that:

- Only one person can cross the door at each second.
- A person may arrive at the door and wait without entering or exiting to follow the mentioned rules.
