Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of **subarrays** of `nums` where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's elements is `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

The **greatest common divisor of an array** is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
