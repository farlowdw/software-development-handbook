You are given an integer `n`. There is an **undirected** graph with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return the number of **complete connected components** of the graph.

A **connected component** is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be **complete** if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.
