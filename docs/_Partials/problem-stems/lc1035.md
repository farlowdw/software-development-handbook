We write the integers of `A` and `B` (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers `A[i]` and `B[j]` such that:

- `A[i] == B[j]`;
- The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.
