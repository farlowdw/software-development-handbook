**Table:** `Teams`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| player_id   | int     |
| team_name   | varchar | 
+-------------+---------+
```

- `player_id` is the unique key for this table.
- Each row contains the unique identifier for player and the name of one of the teams participating in that match.

**Table:** `Passes`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| pass_from   | int     |
| time_stamp  | varchar |
| pass_to     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```
- `(pass_from, time_stamp)` is the unique key for this table.
- `pass_from` is a foreign key to `player_id` from `Teams` table.
- Each row represents a pass made during a match, `time_stamp` represents the time in minutes (`00:00`-`90:00`) when the pass was made,
- `pass_to` is the `player_id` of the player receiving the pass.

Write a solution to find the **longest successful pass streak** for **each team** during the match. The rules are as follows:

- A successful pass streak is defined as consecutive passes where:
  + Both the `pass_from` and `pass_to` players belong to the same team
- A streak breaks when either:
  + The pass is intercepted (received by a player from the opposing team)

Return the result table ordered by `team_name` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

<summary> Example 1</summary>

- **Input:** 

```
Teams table:
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | team_name |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | Arsenal   |
| 2         | Arsenal   |
| 3         | Arsenal   |
| 4         | Arsenal   |
| 5         | Chelsea   |
| 6         | Chelsea   |
| 7         | Chelsea   |
| 8         | Chelsea   |
+-----------+-----------+

Passes table:
+-----------+------------+---------+
| pass_from | time_stamp | pass_to |
+-----------+------------+---------+
| 1         | 00:05      | 2       |
| 2         | 00:07      | 3       |
| 3         | 00:08      | 4       |
| 4         | 00:10      | 5       |
| 6         | 00:15      | 7       |
| 7         | 00:17      | 8       |
| 8         | 00:20      | 6       |
| 6         | 00:22      | 5       |
| 1         | 00:25      | 2       |
| 2         | 00:27      | 3       |
+-----------+------------+---------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+-----------+----------------+
| team_name | longest_streak |
+-----------+----------------+
| Arsenal   | 3              |
| Chelsea   | 4              |
+-----------+----------------+
```

- **Explanation:** 

- **Arsenal**'s streaks:
  + First streak: `3` passes (`1→2→3→4`) ended when player `4` passed to Chelsea's player `5`
  + Second streak: `2` passes (`1→2→3`)
  + Longest streak = `3`
- **Chelsea**'s streaks:
  + First streak: `3` passes (`6→7→8→6→5`)
  + Longest streak = `4`
