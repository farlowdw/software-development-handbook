You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` containing `n` integers.

At each second, you perform the following operation on the array:

- For every index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, replace `nums[i]` with either `nums[i]`, `nums[(i - 1 + n) % n]`, or `nums[(i + 1) % n]`. 

**Note** that all the elements get replaced simultaneously.

Return the **minimum** number of seconds needed to make all elements in the array `nums` equal.
