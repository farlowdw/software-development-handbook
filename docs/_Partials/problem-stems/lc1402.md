A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in `1` unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`

Return the maximum sum of Like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.
