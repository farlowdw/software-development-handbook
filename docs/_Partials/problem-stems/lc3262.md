**Table:** `EmployeeShifts`

```
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| start_time       | time    |
| end_time         | time    |
+------------------+---------+
```

- `(employee_id, start_time)` is the unique key for this table.
- This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees, including the start and end times on a specific date.

Write a solution to count the number of **overlapping shifts** for each employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if one shift's `end_time` is **later than** another shift's `start_time`.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id` in **ascending** order.

The query result format is in the following example.

- **Input:** 

```
+-------------+------------+----------+
| employee_id | start_time | end_time |
+-------------+------------+----------+
| 1           | 08:00:00   | 12:00:00 |
| 1           | 11:00:00   | 15:00:00 |
| 1           | 14:00:00   | 18:00:00 |
| 2           | 09:00:00   | 17:00:00 |
| 2           | 16:00:00   | 20:00:00 |
| 3           | 10:00:00   | 12:00:00 |
| 3           | 13:00:00   | 15:00:00 |
| 3           | 16:00:00   | 18:00:00 |
| 4           | 08:00:00   | 10:00:00 |
| 4           | 09:00:00   | 11:00:00 |
+-------------+------------+----------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+-------------+--------------------+
| employee_id | overlapping_shifts |
+-------------+--------------------+
| 1           | 2                  |
| 2           | 1                  |
| 4           | 1                  |
+-------------+--------------------+
```

- **Explanation:** 

- Employee 1 has 3 shifts:
  + `08:00:00` to `12:00:00`
  + `11:00:00` to `15:00:00`
  + `14:00:00` to `18:00:00`

  The first shift overlaps with the second, and the second overlaps with the third, resulting in 2 overlapping shifts.
- Employee 2 has 2 shifts:
  + `09:00:00` to `17:00:00`
  + `16:00:00` to `20:00:00`

  These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.
- Employee 3 has 3 shifts:
  + `10:00:00` to `12:00:00`
  + `13:00:00` to `15:00:00`
  + `16:00:00` to `18:00:00`

  None of these shifts overlap, so Employee 3 is not included in the output.
- Employee 4 has 2 shifts:
  + `08:00:00` to `10:00:00`
  + `09:00:00` to `11:00:00`

  These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.

The output shows the `employee_id` and the count of overlapping shifts for each employee who has at least one overlapping shift, ordered by `employee_id` in ascending order.
