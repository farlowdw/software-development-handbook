You are given a character array `keys` containing **unique** characters and a string array `values` containing strings of length `2`. You are also given another string array `dictionary` that contains all permitted original strings after decryption. You should implement a data structure that can encrypt or decrypt a **0-indexed** string.

A string is **encrypted** with the following process:

1. For each character `c` in the string, we find the index `i` satisfying `keys[i] == c` in `keys`.
2. Replace `c` with `values[i]` in the string.

A string is **decrypted** with the following process:

1. For each substring `s` of length `2` occurring at an even index in the string, we find an `i` such that `values[i] == s`. If there are multiple valid `i`, we choose any **one** of them. This means a string could have multiple possible strings it can decrypt to.
2. Replace `s` with `keys[i]` in the string.

Implement the `Encrypter` class:

- `Encrypter(char[] keys, String[] values, String[] dictionary)` Initializes the `Encrypter` class with `keys`, `values`, and `dictionary`.
- `String encrypt(String word1)` Encrypts `word1` with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string.
- `int decrypt(String word2)` Returns the number of possible strings `word2` could decrypt to that also appear in `dictionary`.
