You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of nums such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return the **minimum** possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.
