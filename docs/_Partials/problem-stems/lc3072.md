You are given a **1-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`.

We define a function `greaterCount` such that `greaterCount(arr, val)` returns the number of elements in arr that are **strictly greater** than `val`.

You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` using `n` operations. In the first operation, append `nums[1]` to `arr1`. In the second operation, append `nums[2]` to `arr2`. Afterwards, in the `i`th operation:

- If `greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) > greaterCount(arr2, nums[i])`, append `nums[i]` to `arr1`.
- If `greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) < greaterCount(arr2, nums[i])`, append `nums[i]` to `arr2`.
- If `greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) == greaterCount(arr2, nums[i])`, append `nums[i]` to the array with a lesser number of elements.
- If there is still a tie, append `nums[i]` to `arr1`.

The array `result` is formed by concatenating the arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. For example, if `arr1 == [1,2,3]` and `arr2 == [4,5,6]`, then `result = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`.

Return the integer array `result`.
