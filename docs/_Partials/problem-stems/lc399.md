You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where <code>equations[i] = [A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>]</code> and `values[i]` represent the equation <code>A<sub>i</sub> / B<sub>i</sub> = values[i]</code>. Each <code>A<sub>i</sub></code> or <code>B<sub>i</sub></code> is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where <code>queries[j] = [C<sub>j</sub>, D<sub>j</sub>]</code> represents the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query where you must find the answer for <code>C<sub>j</sub> / D<sub>j</sub> = ?</code>.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.
