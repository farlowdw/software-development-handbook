There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row.  The `i`th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging **exactly `K` consecutive** piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return `-1`.
