There is a party where `n` friends numbered from `0` to `n - 1` are attending. There is an **infinite** number of chairs in this party that are numbered from `0` to `infinity`. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the **smallest number**.

- For example, if chairs `0`, `1`, and `5` are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number `2`.

When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `times` where <code>times[i] = [arrival<sub>i</sub>, leaving<sub>i</sub>]</code>, indicating the arrival and leaving times of the `i`th friend respectively, and an integer `targetFriend`. All arrival times are **distinct**.

Return the **chair number** that the friend numbered `targetFriend` will sit on.
