There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

- There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
- There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
- If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` if and only if it is **bipartite**.
