A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number `i` more than `rollMax[i]` (**1-indexed**) **consecutive** times. 

Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact `n` rolls.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
