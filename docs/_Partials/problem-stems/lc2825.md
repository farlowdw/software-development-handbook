You are given two **0-indexed** strings `str1` and `str2`.

In an operation, you select a **set** of indices in `str1`, and for each index `i` in the set, increment `str1[i]` to the next character **cyclically**. That is `'a'` becomes `'b'`, `'b'` becomes `'c'`, and so on, and `'z'` becomes `'a'`.

Return `true` if it is possible to make `str2` a subsequence of `str1` by performing the operation **at most once**, and `false` otherwise.

**Note:** A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
