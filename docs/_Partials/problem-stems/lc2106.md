Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array fruits where fruits <code>[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, amount<sub>i</sub>]</code> depicts <code>amount<sub>i</sub></code> fruits at the position <code>position<sub>i</sub></code>. `fruits` is already **sorted** by <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> in **ascending order**, and each <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> is **unique**.

You are also given an integer `startPos` and an integer `k`. Initially, you are at the position `startPos`. From any position, you can either walk to the **left or right**. It takes **one step** to move **one unit** on the x-axis, and you can walk **at most** `k` steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.

Return the **maximum total number** of fruits you can harvest.
