You are given an `m x n` 2D array `grid` of **positive** integers.

Your task is to traverse `grid` in a **zigzag** pattern while skipping every **alternate** cell.

Zigzag pattern traversal is defined as following the below actions:

- Start at the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.
- Move *right* within a row until the end of the row is reached.
- Drop down to the next row, then traverse *left* until the beginning of the row is reached.
- Continue **alternating** between right and left traversal until every row has been traversed.

**Note** that you **must skip** every alternate cell during the traversal.

Return an array of integers `result` containing, **in order**, the value of the cells visited during the zigzag traversal with skips.
