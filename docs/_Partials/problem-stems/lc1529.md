There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially all the bulbs are **turned off**.

Your task is to obtain the configuration represented by `target` where `target[i]` is `'1'` if the `i`th bulb is turned on and is `'0'` if it is turned off.

You have a switch to flip the state of the bulb, a flip operation is defined as follows:

- Choose **any** bulb (index `i`) of your current configuration.
- Flip each bulb from index `i` to `n-1`.

When any bulb is flipped it means that if it is `0` it changes to `1` and if it is `1` it changes to `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of flips required to form `target`.
