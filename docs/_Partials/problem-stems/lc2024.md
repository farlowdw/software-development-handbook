A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting true and `'F'` denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by **maximizing** the number of **consecutive** questions with the **same** answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `i`th question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:

- Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).

Return the **maximum** number of consecutive `'T'`s or `'F'`s in the answer key after performing the operation at most `k` times.
