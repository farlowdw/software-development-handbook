You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

An integer `h` is called **valid** if all values in the array that are **strictly greater** than `h` are identical.

For example, if `nums = [10, 8, 10, 8]`, a **valid** integer is `h = 9` because all `nums[i] > 9` are equal to `10`, but `5` is not a **valid** integer.

You are allowed to perform the following operation on `nums`:

- Select an integer `h` that is valid for the **current** values in `nums`.
- For each index `i` where `nums[i] > h`, set `nums[i]` to `h`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make every element in `nums` **equal** to `k`. If it is impossible to make all elements equal to `k`, return `-1`.
