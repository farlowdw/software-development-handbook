Given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `'('` and `')'`. A parentheses string is **balanced** if:

- Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `'))'`.
- Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `'))'`.

In other words, we treat `'('` as openning parenthesis and `'))'` as closing parenthesis.

For example, `"())"`, `"())(())))"` and `"(())())))"` are balanced, `")()"`, `"()))"` and `"(()))"` are not balanced.

You can insert the characters `'('` and `')'` at any position of the string to balance it if needed.

Return the minimum number of insertions needed to make `s` balanced.
