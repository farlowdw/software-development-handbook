You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers between `1` and `3`, and a binary array `locked` of the same size.

We consider `nums` **sortable** if it can be sorted using adjacent swaps, where a swap between two indices `i` and `i + 1` is allowed if `nums[i] - nums[i + 1] == 1` and `locked[i] == 0`.

In one operation, you can unlock any index `i` by setting `locked[i]` to `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make `nums` **sortable**. If it is not possible to make `nums` sortable, return `-1`.
