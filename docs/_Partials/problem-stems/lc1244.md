Design a `Leaderboard` class, which has 3 functions:

1. `addScore(playerId, score)`: Update the leaderboard by adding `score` to the given player's score. If there is no player with such id in the leaderboard, add him to the leaderboard with the given `score`.
2. `top(K)`: Return the score sum of the top `K` players.
3. `reset(playerId)`: Reset the score of the player with the given id to 0 (in other words erase it from the leaderboard). It is guaranteed that the player was added to the leaderboard before calling this function.

Initially, the leaderboard is empty.
