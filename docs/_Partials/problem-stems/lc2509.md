You are given an integer `n`. There is a **complete binary tree** with <code>2<sup>n</sup> - 1</code> nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value `1`, and every node with a value `val` in the range <code>[1, 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 - 1]</code> has two children where:

- The left node has the value `2 * val`, and
- The right node has the value `2 * val + 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query, solve the following problem:

1. Add an edge between the nodes with values <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.
2. Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
3. Remove the added edge between nodes with values <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.

Note that:

- A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
- The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
- There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.
