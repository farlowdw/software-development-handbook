Your music player contains `N` different songs and she wants to listen to `L` (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played at least once
- A song can only be played again only if `K` other songs have been played

Return the number of possible playlists.  **As the answer can be very large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>**.
