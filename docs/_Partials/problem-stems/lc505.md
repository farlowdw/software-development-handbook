There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up**, **down**, **left** or **right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the `m x n` maze, the ball's start position and the `destination`, where <code>start = [start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>]</code> and <code>destination = [destination<sub>row</sub>, destination<sub>col</sub>]</code>, return the shortest **distance** for the ball to stop at the destination. If the ball cannot stop at `destination`, return `-1`.

The **distance** is the number of **empty spaces** traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).
