There are `n` projects numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer array `milestones` where each `milestones[i]` denotes the number of milestones the `i`th project has.

You can work on the projects following these two rules:

- Every week, you will finish **exactly one** milestone of **one** project. You **must** work every week.
- You **cannot** work on two milestones from the same project for two **consecutive** weeks.

Once all the milestones of all the projects are finished, or if the only milestones that you can work on will cause you to violate the above rules, you will **stop working**. Note that you may not be able to finish every project's milestones due to these constraints.

Return the **maximum** number of weeks you would be able to work on the projects without violating the rules mentioned above.
