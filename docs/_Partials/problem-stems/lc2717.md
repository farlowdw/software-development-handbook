You are given a **0-indexed** permutation of `n` integers `nums`.

A permutation is called **semi-ordered** if the first number equals `1` and the last number equals `n`. You can perform the below operation as many times as you want until you make `nums` a **semi-ordered** permutation:

- Pick two adjacent elements in `nums`, then swap them.

Return the minimum number of operations to make `nums` a **semi-ordered permutation**.

A **permutation** is a sequence of integers from `1` to `n` of length `n` containing each number exactly once.
