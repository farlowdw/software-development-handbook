You are participating in an online chess tournament. There is a chess round that starts every `15` minutes. The first round of the day starts at `00:00`, and after every `15` minutes, a new round starts.

- For example, the second round starts at `00:15`, the fourth round starts at `00:45`, and the seventh round starts at `01:30`.

You are given two strings `loginTime` and `logoutTime` where:

- `loginTime` is the time you will login to the game, and
- `logoutTime` is the time you will logout from the game.

If `logoutTime` is **earlier** than `loginTime`, this means you have played from `loginTime` to midnight and from midnight to `logoutTime`.

Return the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament.

**Note:** All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at `00:00` and the last round of the day starts at `23:45`.
