Given the array `nums`, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is **strictly greater** than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence. 

If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with **minimum size** and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the **maximum total sum** of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. 

Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be **unique**. Also return the answer sorted in **non-increasing** order.
