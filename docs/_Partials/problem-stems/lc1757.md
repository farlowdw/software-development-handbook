DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  Products (product_id int, low_fats VARCHAR(50) CHECK(low_fats IN ('Y', 'N')), recyclable VARCHAR(50) CHECK(recyclable IN ('Y','N')));

INSERT INTO
  Products 
VALUES
  ('0', 'Y', 'N'),
  ('1', 'Y', 'Y'),
  ('2', 'N', 'Y'),
  ('3', 'Y', 'Y'),
  ('4', 'N', 'N');

**Table:** `Products`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `product_id` is the primary key for this table.
- `low_fats` is an `ENUM` of type `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is low fat and `'N'` means it is not.
- `recyclable` is an `ENUM` of types `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is recyclable and `'N'` means it is not.

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
```

- Only products `1` and `3` are both low fat and recyclable.
