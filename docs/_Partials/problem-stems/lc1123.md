Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

- The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
- The depth of the root of the tree is `0`. if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d + 1`.
- The lowest common ancestor of a set `S` of nodes, is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in `S` is in the subtree with root `A`.
