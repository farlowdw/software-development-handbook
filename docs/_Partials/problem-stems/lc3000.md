You are given a 2D **0-indexed** integer array `dimensions`.

For all indices `i`, `0 <= i < dimensions.length`, `dimensions[i][0]` represents the length and `dimensions[i][1]` represents the width of the rectangle `i`.

Return the **area** of the rectangle having the **longest** diagonal. If there are multiple rectangles with the longest diagonal, return the area of the rectangle having the **maximum** area.
