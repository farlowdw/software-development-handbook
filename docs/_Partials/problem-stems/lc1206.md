Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

A Skiplist is a data structure that takes `O(log(n))` time to `add`, `erase` and `search`. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.

For example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add`, `erase` and `search` can be faster than `O(n)`. It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is `O(log(n))` and space complexity is `O(n)`.

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

- `bool search(int target)`: Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.
- `void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. 
- `bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.
