You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` and a non-negative integer `k`. Each minute, you may take either the **leftmost** character of `s`, or the **rightmost** character of `s`.

Return the **minimum** number of minutes needed for you to take **at least** `k` of each character, or return `-1` if it is not possible to take `k` of each character.
