You are given a sorted integer array `arr` containing `1` and **prime** numbers, where all the integers of `arr` are unique. You are also given an integer `k`.

For every `i` and `j` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`, we consider the fraction `arr[i] / arr[j]`.

Return the `k`th smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size `2`, where `answer[0] == arr[i]` and `answer[1] == arr[j]`.
