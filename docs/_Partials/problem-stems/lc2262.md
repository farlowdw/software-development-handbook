The **appeal** of a string is the number of **distinct** characters found in the string.

- For example, the appeal of `"abbca"` is `3` because it has `3` distinct characters: `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

Given a string `s`, return the **total appeal of all of its substrings**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
