We define the `lcp` matrix of any **0-indexed** string `word` of `n` lowercase English letters as an `n x n` grid such that:

- `lcp[i][j]` is equal to the length of the **longest common prefix** between the substrings `word[i,n-1]` and `word[j,n-1]`.

Given an `n x n` matrix `lcp`, return the alphabetically smallest string `word` that corresponds to `lcp`. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. For example, `"aabd"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aaca"` because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and `'b'` comes before `'c'`.
