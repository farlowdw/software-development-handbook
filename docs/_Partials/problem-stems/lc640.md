Solve a given equation and return the value of `x` in the form of string `"x=#value"`. The equation contains only `'+'`, `'-'` operation, the variable `x` and its coefficient.

If there is no solution for the equation, return `"No solution"`.

If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return `"Infinite solutions"`.

If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of `x` is an integer.
