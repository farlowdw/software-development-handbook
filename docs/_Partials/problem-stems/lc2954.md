You are given an integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `sick` which is **sorted** in **increasing** order.

There are `n` children standing in a queue with positions `0` to `n - 1` assigned to them. The array `sick` contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position `i` can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions `i - 1` and `i + 1` **if** they exist and are currently not infected. **At most one** child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.

It can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An **infection sequence** is the sequential order of positions in which **all** of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note** that an infection sequence **does not** contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.
