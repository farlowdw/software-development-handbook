You are given a binary string `s` of length `n` and an integer `numOps`.

You are allowed to perform the following operation on `s` at most `numOps` times:

- Select any index `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) and **flip** `s[i]`. If `s[i] == '1'`, change `s[i]` to `'0'` and vice versa.

You need to **minimize** the length of the **longest** substring of `s` such that all the characters in the substring are **identical**.

Return the **minimum** length after the operations.
