We have a wooden plank of the length `n` **units**. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with speed **1 unit per second**. Some of the ants move to the **left**, the other move to the **right**.

When two ants moving in two **different** directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions doesn't take any additional time.

When an ant reaches **one end** of the plank at a time `t`, it falls out of the plank imediately.

Given an integer `n` and two integer arrays `left` and `right`, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right. Return the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.
