You are given a **0-indexed** positive integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

A pair of numbers `(num1, num2)` is called **excellent** if the following conditions are satisfied:

- **Both** the numbers `num1` and `num2` exist in the array `nums`.
- The sum of the number of set bits in `num1 OR num2` and `num1 AND num2` is greater than or equal to `k`, where `OR` is the bitwise **OR** operation and `AND` is the bitwise **AND** operation.

Return the number of **distinct** excellent pairs.

Two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are considered distinct if either `a != c` or `b != d`. For example, `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` are distinct.

**Note** that a pair `(num1, num2)` such that `num1 == num2` can also be excellent if you have at least **one** occurrence of `num1` in the array.
