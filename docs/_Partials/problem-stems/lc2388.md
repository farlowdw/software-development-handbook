DROP TABLE IF EXISTS CoffeeShop;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  CoffeeShop (id int, drink varchar(20));

INSERT INTO
  CoffeeShop (id, drink)
VALUES

**Table:** `CoffeeShop`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| drink       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table shows the order id and the name of the drink ordered. Some drink rows are nulls.

Write an SQL query to replace the `null` values of drink with the name of the drink of the previous row that is not `null`. It is guaranteed that the drink of the first row of the table is not `null`.

Return the result table **in the same order as the input**.

The query result format is shown in the following example.
