You are given two strings `s` and `t` of equal length `n`. You can perform the following operation on the string `s`:

- Remove a **suffix** of `s` of length `l` where `0 < l < n` and append it at the start of `s`. For example, let `s = 'abcd'` then in one operation you can remove the suffix `'cd'` and append it in front of `s` making `s = 'cdab'`.

You are also given an integer `k`. Return the number of ways in which `s` can be transformed into `t` in **exactly** `k` operations.

Since the answer can be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
