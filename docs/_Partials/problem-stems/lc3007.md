You are given an integer `k` and an integer `x`.

Consider `s` is the **1-indexed** binary representation of an integer `num`. The **price** of a number `num` is the number of `i`'s such that `i % x == 0` and `s[i]` is a **set bit**.

Return the **greatest** integer `num` such that the sum of **prices** of all numbers from `1` to `num` is less than or equal to `k`.

**Note:**

- In the binary representation of a number **set bit** is a bit of value `1`.
- The binary representation of a number will be indexed from right to left. For example, if `s == 11100`, `s[4] == 1` and `s[2] == 0`.
