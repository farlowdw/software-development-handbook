A `width x height` grid is on an XY-plane with the **bottom-left** cell at `(0, 0)` and the **top-right** cell at `(width - 1, height - 1)`. The grid is aligned with the four cardinal directions (`"North"`, `"East"`, `"South"`, and `"West"`). A robot is initially at cell `(0, 0)` facing direction `"East"`.

The robot can be instructed to move for a specific number of **steps**. For each step, it does the following.

1. Attempts to move **forward one** cell in the direction it is facing.
2. If the cell the robot is **moving to** is **out of bounds**, the robot instead **turns** 90 degrees **counterclockwise** and retries the step.

After the robot finishes moving the number of steps required, it stops and awaits the next instruction.

Implement the `Robot` class:

- `Robot(int width, int height)` Initializes the `width x height` grid with the robot at `(0, 0)` facing `"East"`.
- `void move(int num)` Instructs the robot to move forward `num` steps.
- `int[] getPos()` Returns the current cell the robot is at, as an array of length `2`, `[x, y]`.
- String `getDir()` Returns the current direction of the robot, `"North"`, `"East"`, `"South"`, or `"West"`.
