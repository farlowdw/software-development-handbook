You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, of equal length `n`.

In one operation, you can swap the values of any two indices of `nums1`. The **cost** of this operation is the **sum** of the indices.

Find the **minimum** total cost of performing the given operation **any** number of times such that `nums1[i] != nums2[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1` after performing all the operations.

Return the **minimum total cost** such that `nums1` and `nums2` satisfy the above condition. In case it is not possible, return `-1`.
