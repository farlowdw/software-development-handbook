Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:

- Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
- Each number is used **at most once**.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.
