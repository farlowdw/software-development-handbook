There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:

- Eat one orange.
- If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by `2` then you can eat `n/2` oranges.
- If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by `3` then you can eat `2*(n/3)` oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Return the minimum number of days to eat `n` oranges.
