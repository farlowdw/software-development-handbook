Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed `1` or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.
