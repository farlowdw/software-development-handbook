There is a group of `n` members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The `i`th crime generates a `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a **profitable scheme** any subset of these crimes that generates at least `minProfit` profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most `n`.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
