Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
  public int val;
  public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**Adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.
