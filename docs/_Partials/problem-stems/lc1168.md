There are `n` houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house `i`, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost `wells[i - 1]` (note the `-1` due to **0-indexing**), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array `pipes`, where each <code>pipes[j] = [house1<sub>j</sub>, house2<sub>j</sub>, cost<sub>j</sub>]</code> represents the cost to connect <code>house1<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>house2<sub>j</sub></code> together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Return the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.
