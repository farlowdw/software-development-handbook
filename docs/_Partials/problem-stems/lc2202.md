You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the contents of a **pile**, where `nums[0]` is the topmost element of the pile.

In one move, you can perform **either** of the following:

- If the pile is not empty, **remove** the topmost element of the pile.
- If there are one or more removed elements, **add** any one of them back onto the pile. This element becomes the new topmost element.

You are also given an integer `k`, which denotes the total number of moves to be made.

Return the **maximum value** of the topmost element of the pile possible after **exactly** `k` moves. In case it is not possible to obtain a non-empty pile after `k` moves, return `-1`.
