You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `i`th job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `i`th job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return `-1`.
