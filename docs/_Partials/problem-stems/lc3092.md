The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time. You have two integer arrays, `nums` and `freq`, of equal length `n`. Each element in `nums` represents an ID, and the corresponding element in `freq` indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.

- **Addition of IDs:** If `freq[i]` is positive, it means `freq[i]` IDs with the value `nums[i]` are added to the collection at step `i`.
- **Removal of IDs:** If `freq[i]` is negative, it means `-freq[i]` IDs with the value `nums[i]` are removed from the collection at step `i`.

Return an array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i]` represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the `i`th step. If the collection is empty at any step, `ans[i]` should be `0` for that step.
