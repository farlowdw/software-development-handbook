You are given a **0-indexed** array of **distinct** integers `nums`.

There is an element in `nums` that has the **lowest** value and an element that has the **highest** value. We call them the **minimum** and **maximum** respectively. Your goal is to remove **both** these elements from the array.

A **deletion** is defined as either removing an element from the **front** of the array or removing an element from the **back** of the array.

Return the **minimum** number of deletions it would take to remove **both** the minimum and maximum element from the array.
