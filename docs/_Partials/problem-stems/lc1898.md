You are given two strings `s` and `p` where `p` is a **subsequence** of `s`. You are also given a **distinct 0-indexed** integer array `removable` containing a subset of indices of `s` (`s` is also **0-indexed**).

You want to choose an integer `k` (`0 <= k <= removable.length`) such that, after removing `k` characters from `s` using the **first** `k` indices in `removable`, `p` is still a **subsequence** of `s`. More formally, you will mark the character at `s[removable[i]]` for each `0 <= i < k`, then remove all marked characters and check if `p` is still a subsequence.

Return the **maximum** `k` you can choose such that `p` is still a **subsequence** of `s` after the removals.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
