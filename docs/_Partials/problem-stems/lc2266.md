Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The **mapping** of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.

</p>

In order to **add** a letter, Alice has to **press** the key of the corresponding digit `i` times, where `i` is the position of the letter in the key.

- For example, to add the letter `'s'`, Alice has to press `'7'` four times. Similarly, to add the letter `'k'`, Alice has to press `'5'` twice.
- Note that the digits `'0'` and `'1'` do not map to any letters, so Alice **does not** use them.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a **string of pressed keys** instead.

- For example, when Alice sent the message `"bob"`, Bob received the string `"2266622"`.

Given a string `pressedKeys` representing the string received by Bob, return the **total number of possible text messages** Alice could have sent.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
