You are given an unrooted weighted tree with `n` vertices representing servers numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, an array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional edge between vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub></code> of weight <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer `signalSpeed`.

Two servers `a` and `b` are **connectable** through a server `c` if:

- `a < b`, `a != c` and `b != c`.
- The distance from `c` to `a` is divisible by `signalSpeed`.
- The distance from `c` to `b` is divisible by `signalSpeed`.
- The path from `c` to `b` and the path from `c` to `a` do not share any edges.

Return an integer array `count` of length `n` where `count[i]` is the **number** of server pairs that are **connectable** through the server `i`.
