You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose an integer `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length - 1` and `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]`. Replace the element `nums[i + 1]` with `nums[i] + nums[i + 1]` and delete the element `nums[i]` from the array.

Return the value of the **largest** element that you can possibly obtain in the final array.
