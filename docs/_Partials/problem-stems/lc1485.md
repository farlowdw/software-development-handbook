A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`. `NodeCopy` class is just a clone of `Node` class with the same attributes and constructors.
