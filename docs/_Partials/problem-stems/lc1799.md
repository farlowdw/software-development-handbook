You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of size `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations on this array.

In the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

- Choose two elements, `x` and `y`.
- Receive a score of `i * gcd(x, y)`.
- Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.

Return the maximum score you can receive after performing `n` operations.

The function `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
