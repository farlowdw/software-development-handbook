A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to design and implement the following interfaces in an efficient manner.

- `addRange(int left, int right)` Adds the half-open interval `[left, right)`, tracking every real number in that interval. Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval `[left, right)` that are not already tracked.
- `queryRange(int left, int right)` Returns `true` if and only if every real number in the interval `[left, right)` is currently being tracked.
- `removeRange(int left, int right)` Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the interval `[left, right)`.
