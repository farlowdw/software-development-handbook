You are given a `m x n` 2D array `board` representing a chessboard, where `board[i][j]` represents the **value** of the cell `(i, j)`.

Rooks in the **same** row or column **attack** each other. You need to place three rooks on the chessboard such that the rooks **do not attack** each other.

Return the **maximum** sum of the cell **values** on which the rooks are placed.
