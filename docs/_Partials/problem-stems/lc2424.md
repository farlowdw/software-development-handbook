You are given a stream of `n` videos, each represented by a **distinct** number from `1` to `n` that you need to "upload" to a server. You need to implement a data structure that calculates the length of the **longest uploaded prefix** at various points in the upload process.

We consider `i` to be an uploaded prefix if all videos in the range `1` to `i` (**inclusive**) have been uploaded to the server. The longest uploaded prefix is the **maximum** value of `i` that satisfies this definition.

Implement the `LUPrefix` class:

- `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object for a stream of `n` videos.
- `void upload(int video)` Uploads `video` to the server.
- `int longest()` Returns the length of the **longest uploaded prefix** defined above.
