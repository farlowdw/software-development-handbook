You are given an integer `n` denoting the total number of servers and a **2D 0-indexed** integer array `logs`, where `logs[i] = [server_id, time]` denotes that the server with id `server_id` received a request at time `time`.

You are also given an integer `x` and a **0-indexed** integer array `queries`.

Return a **0-indexed** integer array `arr` of length `queries.length` where `arr[i]` represents the number of servers that **did not receive** any requests during the time interval <code>[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]</code>.

Note that the time intervals are inclusive.
