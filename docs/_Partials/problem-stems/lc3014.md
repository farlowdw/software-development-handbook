You are given a string `word` containing **distinct** lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with **distinct** collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key `2` is mapped with `["a","b","c"]`, we need to push the key one time to type `"a"`, two times to type `"b"`, and three times to type `"c"`.

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered `2` to `9` to **distinct** collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to **any** amount of letters, but each letter **must** be mapped to **exactly** one key. You need to find the **minimum** number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return the **minimum** number of pushes needed to type `word` after remapping the keys.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that `1`, `*`, `#`, and `0` do **not** map to any letters.
