You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where <code>tasks[i] = [enqueueTime<sub>i</sub>, processingTime<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that the `i`th task will be available to process at <code>enqueueTime<sub>i</sub></code> and will take <code>processingTime<sub>i</sub></code> to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process **at most one** task at a time and will act in the following way:

- If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
- If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
- Once a task is started, the CPU will **process the entire task** without stopping.
- The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.
