Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, you can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

- Select two **adjacent** elements of the array like `x` and `y`, such that `x * y <= k`, and replace both of them with a **single element** with value `x * y` (e.g. in one operation the array `[1, 2, 2, 3]` with `k = 5` can become `[1, 4, 3]` or `[2, 2, 3]`, but can't become `[1, 2, 6]`).

Return the **minimum** possible length of `nums` after any number of operations.
