You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let `a` be the first half and `b` be the second half.

Two strings are **alike** if they have the same number of vowels (`'a`', `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, `'A'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`). Notice that `s` contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if `a` and `b` are **alike**. Otherwise, return `false`.
