You are given a **0-indexed** `8 x 8` grid `board`, where `board[r][c]` represents the cell `(r, c)` on a game board. On the board, free cells are represented by `'.'`, white cells are represented by `'W'`, and black cells are represented by `'B'`.

Each move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). However, a move is only **legal** if, after changing it, the cell becomes the **endpoint of a good line** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

A **good line** is a line of **three or more cells (including the endpoints)** where the endpoints of the line are **one color**, and the remaining cells in the middle are the **opposite color** (no cells in the line are free). You can find examples for good lines in the figure below:

Given two integers `rMove` and `cMove` and a character `color` representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return `true` if changing cell `(rMove, cMove)` to color `color` is a **legal** move, or `false` if it is not legal.
