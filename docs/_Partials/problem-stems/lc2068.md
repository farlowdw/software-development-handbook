Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered **almost equivalent** if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from `'a'` to `'z'` between `word1` and `word2` is **at most** `3`.

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length n, return true if `word1` and `word2` are **almost equivalent**, or `false` otherwise.

The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.
