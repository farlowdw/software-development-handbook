`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve the problem in $O(1)$ extra memory space?
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
