Given the **API** `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 7]`, write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 10]`. You can only call the API `rand7()`, and you shouldn't call any other API. Please **do not** use a language's built-in random API.

Each test case will have one **internal** argument `n`, the number of times that your implemented function `rand10()` will be called while testing. Note that this is **not an argument** passed to `rand10()`.
