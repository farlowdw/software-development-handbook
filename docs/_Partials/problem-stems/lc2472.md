You are given a string `s` and a **positive** integer `k`.

Select a set of **non-overlapping** substrings from the string `s` that satisfy the following conditions:

- The **length** of each substring is **at least** `k`.
- Each substring is a **palindrome**.

Return the **maximum** number of substrings in an optimal selection.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
