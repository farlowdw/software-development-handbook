You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and an integer `multiplier`.

You need to perform `k` operations on `nums`. In each operation:

- Find the **minimum** value `x` in `nums`. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears **first**.
- Replace the selected minimum value `x` with `x * multiplier`.

Return an integer array denoting the final state of `nums` after performing all `k` operations.
