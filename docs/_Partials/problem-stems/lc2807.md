Given the head of a linked list `head`, in which each node contains an integer value.

Between every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal to the **greatest common divisor** of them.

Return the linked list after insertion.

The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
