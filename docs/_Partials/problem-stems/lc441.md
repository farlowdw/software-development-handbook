You have a total of `n` coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> row must have exactly `k` coins.

Given `n`, find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be formed.

`n` is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
