Given a string `S` of `'('` and `')'` parentheses, we add the minimum number of parentheses (`'('` or `')'`, and in any positions) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as (`A`), where `A` is a valid string.

Given a parentheses string, return the minimum number of parentheses we must add to make the resulting string valid.
