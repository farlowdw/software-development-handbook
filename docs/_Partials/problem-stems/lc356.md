Given `n` points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given points symmetrically, in other words, answer whether or not if there exists a line that after reflecting all points over the given line the set of the original points is the same that the reflected ones.

Note that there can be repeated points.
