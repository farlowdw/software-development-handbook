Given a positive integer `n`, find and return the **longest distance** between any two **adjacent** `1`'s in the binary representation of `n`. If there are no two adjacent `1`'s, return `0`.

Two `1`'s are **adjacent** if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly no `0`'s). The **distance** between two `1`'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `"1001"` have a distance of `3`.
