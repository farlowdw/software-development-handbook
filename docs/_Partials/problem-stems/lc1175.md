Return the number of permutations of `1` to `n` so that prime numbers are at prime indices (**1-indexed**)

(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)

Since the answer may be large, return the answer **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
