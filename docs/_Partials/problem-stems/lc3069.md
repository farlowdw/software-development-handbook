You are given a **1-indexed** array of **distinct** integers `nums` of length `n`.

You need to distribute all the elements of `nums` between two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` using `n` operations. In the first operation, append `nums[1]` to `arr1`. In the second operation, append `nums[2]` to `arr2`. Afterwards, in the `i`th operation:

- If the last element of `arr1` is greater than the last element of `arr2`, append `nums[i]` to `arr1`. Otherwise, append `nums[i]` to `arr2`.

The array `result` is formed by concatenating the arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. For example, if `arr1 == [1,2,3]` and `arr2 == [4,5,6]`, then `result = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`.

Return the array `result`.
