Each character of the English alphabet has been mapped to a digit as shown below.

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='200px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/2950-f1.png').default} />
</div>

A string is **divisible** if the sum of the mapped values of its characters is divisible by its length.

Given a string `s`, return the number of **divisible substrings** of `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
