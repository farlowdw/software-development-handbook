Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the `i`th folder in the file system.

- For example, `["one", "two", "three"]` represents the path `"/one/two/three"`.

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are **identical** if they contain the **same non-empty** set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders **do not** need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are **identical**, then **mark** the folders as well as all their subfolders.

- For example, folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should **all** be marked:
  + `/a`
  + `/a/x`
  + `/a/x/y`
  + `/a/z`
  + `/b`
  + `/b/x`
  + `/b/x/y`
  + `/b/z`
- However, if the file structure also included the path `"/b/w"`, then the folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` would not be identical. Note that `"/a/x"` and `"/b/x"` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will **delete** all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return the 2D array `ans` containing the paths of the **remaining** folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in **any** order.
