**Table:** `UserVisits`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| visit_date  | date |
+-------------+------+
```

**Note:**

- This table does not have a primary key.
- This table contains logs of the dates that users vistied a certain retailer.

Assume today's date is `'2021-1-1'`.

Write an SQL query that will, for each `user_id`, find out the largest `window` of days between each visit and the one right after it (or today if you are considering the last visit).

Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
UserVisits table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2020-11-28 |
| 1       | 2020-10-20 |
| 1       | 2020-12-3  |
| 2       | 2020-10-5  |
| 2       | 2020-12-9  |
| 3       | 2020-11-11 |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+---------+---------------+
| user_id | biggest_window|
+---------+---------------+
| 1       | 39            |
| 2       | 65            |
| 3       | 51            |
+---------+---------------+
```

- For the first user, the windows in question are between dates:
  + `2020-10-20` and `2020-11-28` with a total of `39` days. 
  + `2020-11-28` and `2020-12-3` with a total of `5` days. 
  + `2020-12-3` and `2021-1-1` with a total of `29` days.
Making the biggest window the one with 39 days.
- For the second user, the windows in question are between dates:
    + `2020-10-5` and `2020-12-9` with a total of `65` days.
    + `2020-12-9` and `2021-1-1` with a total of `23` days.
Making the biggest window the one with `65` days.
- For the third user, the only window in question is between dates `2020-11-11` and `2021-1-1` with a total of `51` days.
