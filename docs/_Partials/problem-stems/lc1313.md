We are given a list `nums` of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`). For each such pair, there are `freq` elements with value `val` concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.
