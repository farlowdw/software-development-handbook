Given a 2D grid consisting of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`s.

The grid is said to be **connected** if we have **exactly one island**, otherwise is said **disconnected**.

In one day, we are allowed to change **any** single land cell `(1)` into a water cell `(0)`.

Return the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid.
