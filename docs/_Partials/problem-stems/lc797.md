Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).
