You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer `t` representing the number of **transformations** to perform, and an array `nums` of size `26`. In one **transformation**, every character in `s` is replaced according to the following rules:

- Replace `s[i]` with the **next** `nums[s[i] - 'a']` consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if `s[i] = 'a'` and `nums[0] = 3`, the character `'a'` transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in `"bcd"`.
- The transformation **wraps** around the alphabet if it exceeds `'z'`. For example, if `s[i] = 'y'` and `nums[24] = 3`, the character `'y'` transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in `"zab"`.

Return the length of the resulting string after **exactly** `t` transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
