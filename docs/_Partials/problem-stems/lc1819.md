You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The **GCD** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides **all** the numbers in the sequence evenly.

- For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

- For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of <code>[1,2,1,<b><u>2</u></b>,4,1,<b><u>5</u></b>,<b><u>10</u></b>]</code>.

Return the **number** of **different** GCDs among all **non-empty** subsequences of `nums`.
