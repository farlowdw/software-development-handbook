You are given a list of bombs. The **range** of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a **circle** with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `bombs` where <code>bombs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code>. <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the `i`th bomb, whereas <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> denotes the **radius** of its range.

You may choose to detonate a **single** bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate **all bombs** that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of `bombs`, return the **maximum** number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate **only one** bomb.
