In a group of `N` people (labelled `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

For convenience, we'll call the person with label `x`, simply "person `x`".

We'll say that `richer[i] = [x, y]` if person `x` definitely has more money than person `y`.  Note that `richer` may only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say `quiet[x] = q` if person `x` has quietness `q`.

Now, return `answer`, where `answer[x] = y` if `y` is the least quiet person (that is, the person `y` with the smallest value of `quiet[y]`), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person `x`.
