There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

- On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
- Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, **the same color cannot be used again**.

You are given a `m x n` matrix `targetGrid`, where `targetGrid[row][col]` is the color in the position `(row, col)` of the grid.

Return `true` if it is possible to print the matrix `targetGrid`, otherwise, return `false`.
