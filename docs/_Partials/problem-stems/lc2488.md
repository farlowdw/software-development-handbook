You are given an array `nums` of size `n` consisting of **distinct** integers from `1` to `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Return the number of non-empty subarrays in `nums` that have a **median** equal to `k`.

**Note:**

- The median of an array is the **middle** element after sorting the array in **ascending** order. If the array is of even length, the median is the **left** middle element.
  + For example, the median of `[2,3,1,4]` is `2`, and the median of `[8,4,3,5,1]` is `4`.
- A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
