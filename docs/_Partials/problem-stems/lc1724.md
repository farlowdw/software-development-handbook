An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where <code>edgeList[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, dis<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>i</sub></code> with distance <code>dis<sub>i</sub></code>. Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes, and the graph may not be connected.

Implement the `DistanceLimitedPathsExist` class:

- `DistanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, int[][] edgeList)` Initializes the class with an undirected graph.
- `boolean query(int p, int q, int limit)` Returns `true` if there exists a path from `p` to `q` such that each edge on the path has a distance **strictly less than** `limit`, and otherwise `false`.
