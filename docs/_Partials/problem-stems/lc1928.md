There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a road between cities <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> that takes <code>time<sub>i</sub></code> minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return the **minimum cost** to complete your journey, or `-1` if you cannot complete it within `maxTime` minutes.
