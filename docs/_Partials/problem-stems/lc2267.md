A parentheses string is a **non-empty** string consisting only of `'('` and `')'`. It is **valid** if **any** of the following conditions is **true**:

- It is `()`.
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid parentheses strings.
- It can be written as (`A`), where `A` is a valid parentheses string.

You are given an `m x n` matrix of parentheses `grid`. A **valid parentheses string path** in the grid is a path satisfying **all** of the following conditions:

- The path starts from the upper left cell `(0, 0)`.
- The path ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
- The path only ever moves **down** or **right**.
- The resulting parentheses string formed by the path is **valid**.

Return `true` if there exists a **valid parentheses string path** in the grid. Otherwise, return `false`.
