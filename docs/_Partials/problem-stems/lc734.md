We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence `"I am happy with leetcode"` can be represented as `arr = ["I","am",happy","with","leetcode"]`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs `similarPairs` where <code>similarPairs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the two words <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> are similar.

Return `true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar, or `false` if they are not similar.

Two sentences are similar if:

- They have **the same length** (i.e. the same number of words)
- `sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words `a` and `b` are similar and the words `b` and `c` are similar, `a` and `c` are **not necessarily similar**.
