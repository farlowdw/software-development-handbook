Implement a `MyCalendar` class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

Your class will have the method, `book(int start, int end)`. Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.)

For each call to the method `MyCalendar.book`, return `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: `MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)`
