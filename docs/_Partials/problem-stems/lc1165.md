There is a special keyboard with **all keys in a single row**.

Given a string `keyboard` of length `26` indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from `0` to `25`). Initially, your finger is at index `0`. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index `i` to index `j` is `|i - j|`.

You want to type a string `word`. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.
