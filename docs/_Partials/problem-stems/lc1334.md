There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array edges where edgescc
[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>to<sub>i</sub></code>, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
