You are given an array of strings `words`. Each element of `words` consists of **two** lowercase English letters.

Create the **longest possible palindrome** by selecting some elements from `words` and concatenating them in **any order**. Each element can be selected **at most once**.

Return the **length** of the longest palindrome that you can create. If it is impossible to create any palindrome, return `0`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
