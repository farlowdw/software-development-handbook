You are given an integer array `stations` that represents the positions of the gas stations on the **x-axis**. You are also given an integer `k`.

You should add `k` new gas stations. You can add the stations anywhere on the **x-axis**, and not necessarily on an integer position.

Let `penalty()` be the maximum distance between **adjacent** gas stations after adding the `k` new stations.

Return the smallest possible value of `penalty()`. Answers within <code>10<sup>-6</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.
