You are given an integer `n`.

A string `s` is called **good** if it contains only lowercase English characters **and** it is possible to rearrange the characters of `s` such that the new string contains `"leet"` as a **substring**.

For example:

- The string `"lteer"` is good because we can rearrange it to form `"leetr"`.
- `"letl"` is not good because we cannot rearrange it to contain `"leet"` as a substring.

Return the **total** number of good strings of length `n`.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
