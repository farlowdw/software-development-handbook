You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer array `queries`, and an integer `x`.

For each `queries[i]`, you need to find the index of the `queries[i]`th occurrence of `x` in the `nums` array. If there are fewer than `queries[i]` occurrences of `x`, the answer should be `-1` for that query.

Return an integer array `answer` containing the answers to all queries.
