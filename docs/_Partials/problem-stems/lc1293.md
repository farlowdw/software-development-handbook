Given a `m * n` grid, where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). In one step, you can move up, down, left or right from and to an empty cell.

Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m-1, n-1)` given that you can eliminate **at most** `k` obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return `-1`.
