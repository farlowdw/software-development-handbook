An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

- For example, `[1,3,5,7,9]`, `[7,7,7,7]`, and `[3,-1,-5,-9]` are arithmetic sequences.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of arithmetic **subarrays** of `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
