You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`, both of which are **permutations** of `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`.

A **good triplet** is a set of `3` **distinct** values which are present in **increasing order** by position both in `nums1` and `nums2`. In other words, if we consider <code>pos1<sub>v</sub></code> as the index of the value `v` in `nums1` and <code>pos2<sub>v</sub></code> as the index of the value `v` in `nums2`, then a good triplet will be a set `(x, y, z)` where `0 <= x, y, z <= n - 1`, such that <code>pos1<sub>x</sub> < pos1<sub>y</sub> < pos1<sub>z</sub></code> and <code>pos2<sub>x</sub> < pos2<sub>y</sub> < pos2<sub>z</sub></code>.

Return the **total number** of good triplets.
