Given an array of integers `numbers` that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (**1-indexed**) as an integer array `answer` of size `2`, where `1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution** and you **may not** use the same element twice.
