You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. You are also given a **non-negative** integer `k`.

Return the number of **submatrices** of `grid` that satisfy the following conditions:

- The maximum element in the submatrix **less than or equal to** `k`.
- Each row in the submatrix is sorted in **non-increasing** order.

A submatrix `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` is a matrix that forms by choosing all cells `grid[x][y]` where `x1 <= x <= x2` and `y1 <= y <= y2`.
