A bus has `n` stops numbered from `0` to `n - 1` that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where `distance[i]` is the distance between the stops number `i` and `(i + 1) % n`.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given `start` and `destination` stops.
