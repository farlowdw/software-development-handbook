You are given a string `word` and an integer `k`.

A substring `s` of `word` is **complete** if:

- Each character in `s` occurs **exactly** `k` times.
- The difference between two adjacent characters is **at most** `2`. That is, for any two adjacent characters `c1` and `c2` in `s`, the absolute difference in their positions in the alphabet is **at most** `2`.

Return the number of **complete** substrings of `word`.

A **substring** is a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
