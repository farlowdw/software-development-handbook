You are given a string, `message`, and a positive integer, `limit`.

You must **split** `message` into one or more **parts** based on `limit`. Each resulting part should have the suffix `"<a/b>"`, where `"b"` is to be **replaced** with the total number of parts and `"a"` is to be **replaced** with the index of the part, starting from `1` and going up to `b`. Additionally, the length of each resulting part (including its suffix) should be **equal** to `limit`, except for the last part whose length can be **at most** `limit`.

The resulting parts should be formed such that when their suffixes are removed and they are all concatenated **in order**, they should be equal to `message`. Also, the result should contain as few parts as possible.

Return the parts `message` would be split into as an array of strings. If it is impossible to split `message` as required, return an empty array.
