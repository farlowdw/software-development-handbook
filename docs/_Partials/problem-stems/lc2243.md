You are given a string `s` consisting of digits and an integer `k`.

A **round** can be completed if the length of `s` is greater than `k`. In one round, do the following:

1. **Divide** `s` into **consecutive groups** of size `k` such that the first `k` characters are in the first group, the next `k` characters are in the second group, and so on. **Note** that the size of the last group can be smaller than `k`.
2. **Replace** each group of `s` with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, `"346"` is replaced with `"13"` because `3 + 4 + 6 = 13`.
3. **Merge** consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than `k`, repeat from step `1`.

Return `s` after all rounds have been completed.
