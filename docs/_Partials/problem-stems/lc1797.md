There is an authentication system that works with authentication tokens. For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire `timeToLive` seconds after the `currentTime`. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be **extended** to expire `timeToLive` seconds after the (potentially different) `currentTime`.

Implement the `AuthenticationManager` class:

- `AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive)` constructs the `AuthenticationManager` and sets the `timeToLive`.
- `generate(string tokenId, int currentTime)` generates a new token with the given `tokenId` at the given `currentTime` in seconds.
- `renew(string tokenId, int currentTime)` renews the unexpired token with the given `tokenId` at the given `currentTime` in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given `tokenId`, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.
- `countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime)` returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given `currentTime`.

Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time `t` (`renew` or `countUnexpiredTokens`), the expiration takes place **before** the other actions.
