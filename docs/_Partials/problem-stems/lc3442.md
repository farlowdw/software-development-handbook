You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the **maximum** difference between the frequency of **two** characters in the string such that:

- One of the characters has an **even frequency** in the string.
- The other character has an **odd frequency** in the string.

Return the maximum difference, calculated as the frequency of the character with an odd frequency minus the frequency of the character with an even frequency.
