Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.

- For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should **reverse** the segment that starts at `0` and ends at `3` (**inclusive**). The resulting string will be <code>"<u>dcba</u>efd"</code>.

Return the resulting string.
