You are given a `0-indexed` 2D integer array `nums` representing the coordinates of the cars parking on a number line. For any index `i`, <code>nums[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> where <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> is the starting point of the `i`th car and `end<sub>i</sub>` is the ending point of the `i`th car.

Return the number of integer points on the line that are covered with **any part** of a car.
