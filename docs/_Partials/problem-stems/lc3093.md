You are given two arrays of strings `wordsContainer` and `wordsQuery`.

For each `wordsQuery[i]`, you need to find a string from `wordsContainer` that has the **longest common suffix** with `wordsQuery[i]`. If there are two or more strings in `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the **smallest** in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the **same** smallest length, find the one that occurred **earlier** in `wordsContainer`.

Return an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[i]` is the index of the string in `wordsContainer` that has the **longest common suffix** with `wordsQuery[i]`.
