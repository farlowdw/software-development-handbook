You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `arr`, and an `m x n` integer **matrix** `mat`. `arr` and `mat` both contain **all** the integers in the range `[1, m * n]`.

Go through each index `i` in `arr` starting from index `0` and paint the cell in `mat` containing the integer `arr[i]`.

Return the smallest index `i` at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in `mat`.
