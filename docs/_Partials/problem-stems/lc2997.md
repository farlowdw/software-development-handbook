You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

You can apply the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose **any** element of the array and **flip** a bit in its **binary** representation. Flipping a bit means changing a `0` to `1` or vice versa.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make the bitwise `XOR` of **all** elements of the final array equal to `k`.

**Note** that you can flip leading zero bits in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number <code>(101)<sub>2</sub></code> you can flip the fourth bit and obtain <code>(1101)<sub>2</sub></code>.
