There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.

Initially, **all** nodes are **unmarked**. After every second, you mark all unmarked nodes which have **at least** one marked node adjacent to them.

Return an array `nodes` where `nodes[i]` is the last node to get marked in the tree, if you mark node `i` at time `t = 0`. If `nodes[i]` has multiple answers for any node `i`, you can choose **any** one answer.
