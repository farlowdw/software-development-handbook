You are given three strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. You have to perform the following operation on these three strings **as many times** as you want.

In one operation you can choose one of these three strings such that its length is at least `2` and delete the **rightmost** character of it.

Return the **minimum** number of operations you need to perform to make the three strings equal if there is a way to make them equal, otherwise, return `-1`.
