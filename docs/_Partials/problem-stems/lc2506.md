You are given a **0-indexed** string array `words`.

Two strings are **similar** if they consist of the same characters.

- For example, `"abca"` and `"cba"` are similar since both consist of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- However, `"abacba"` and `"bcfd"` are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < j <= word.length - 1` and the two strings `words[i]` and `words[j]` are similar.
