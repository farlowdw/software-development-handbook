Given two strings `a` and `b`, find the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between them.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`. For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"` because you can delete the underlined characters in <code>"a<u>e</u>b<u>d</u>c"</code> to get `"abc"`. Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of one but not the other**.

Return the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between `a` and `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return `-1`.
