Given a string `s`, find two **disjoint palindromic subsequences** of `s` such that the **product** of their lengths is **maximized**. The two subsequences are **disjoint** if they do not both pick a character at the same index.

Return the **maximum** possible **product** of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.
