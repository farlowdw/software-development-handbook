Given a string `S` of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on `S` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.
