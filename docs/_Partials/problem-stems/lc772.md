Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'` operators, and open `'('` and closing parentheses `')'`. The integer division should **truncate toward zero**.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of <code>[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]</code>.
