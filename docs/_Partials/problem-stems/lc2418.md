You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of **distinct** positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `i`th person.

Return `names` sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights.
