Given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` where `words[i]` is either a positive integer represented as a string or the string `"prev"`.

Start iterating from the beginning of the array; for every `"prev"` string seen in `words`, find the **last visited integer** in `words` which is defined as follows:

- Let `k` be the number of consecutive `"prev"` strings seen so far (containing the current string). Let `nums` be the **0-indexed** array of **integers** seen so far and `nums_reverse` be the reverse of `nums`, then the integer at `(k - 1)`th index of `nums_reverse` will be the **last visited integer** for this `"prev"`.
- If `k` is **greater** than the total visited integers, then the last visited integer will be `-1`.

Return an integer array containing the last visited integers.
