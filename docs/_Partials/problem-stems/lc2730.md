You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` that consists of digits from `0` to `9`.

A string `t` is called a **semi-repetitive** if there is at most one consecutive pair of the same digits inside `t`.

Return the length of the longest **semi-repetitive** substring inside `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.
