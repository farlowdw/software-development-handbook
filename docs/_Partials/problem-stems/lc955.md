You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `["bef", "vyz"]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices `answer` such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in **lexicographic** order (i.e., `strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2] <= ... <= strs[n - 1]`). Return the minimum possible value of `answer.length`.
