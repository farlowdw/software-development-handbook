Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of `A` that are squareful. Two permutations `A1` and `A2` differ if and only if there is some index `i` such that `A1[i] != A2`[i].
