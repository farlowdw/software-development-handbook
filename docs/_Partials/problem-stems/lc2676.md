Given a function `fn` and a time in milliseconds `t`, return a **throttled** version of that function.

A **throttled** function is first called without delay and then, for a time interval of `t` milliseconds, can't be executed but should store the latest function arguments provided to call `fn` with them after the end of the delay.

For instance, `t = 50ms`, and the function was called at `30ms`, `40ms`, and `60ms`. The first function call would block calling functions for the following t milliseconds. The second function call would save arguments, and the third call arguments should overwrite currently stored arguments from the second call because the second and third calls are called before `80ms`. Once the delay has passed, the throttled function should be called with the latest arguments provided during the delay period, and it should also create another delay period of `80ms + t`.

The above diagram shows how throttle will transform events. Each rectangle represents `100ms` and the throttle time is `400ms`. Each color represents a different set of inputs.
