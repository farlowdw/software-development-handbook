You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, `s = "ab"` has a change of a key while `s = "bBBb"` does not have any.

Return the number of times the user had to change the key.

**Note:** Modifiers like `shift` or `caps lock` won't be counted in changing the key that is if a user typed the letter `'a'` and then the letter `'A'` then it will not be considered as a changing of key.
