Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be **special floors**, used for relaxation only.

You are given two integers `bottom` and `top`, which denote that Alice has rented all the floors from `bottom` to `top` (**inclusive**). You are also given the integer array `special`, where `special[i]` denotes a special floor that Alice has designated for relaxation.

Return the **maximum** number of consecutive floors without a special floor.
