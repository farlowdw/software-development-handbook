**Table:** `Failed`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
```

- Primary key for this table is `fail_date`.
- Failed table contains the days of failed tasks.

**Table:** `Succeeded`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
```

- Primary key for this table is `success_date`.
- Succeeded table contains the days of succeeded tasks.

A system is running one task **every day**. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of `period_state` for each continuous interval of days in the period from `2019-01-01` to `2019-12-31`.

`period_state` is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as `start_date` and `end_date`.

Order result by `start_date`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+

Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+


Result table:
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
```

- The report ignored the system state in `2018` as we care about the system in the period `2019-01-01` to `2019-12-31`.
- From `2019-01-01` to `2019-01-03` all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
- From `2019-01-04` to `2019-01-05` all tasks failed and system state was "failed".
- From `2019-01-06` to `2019-01-06` all tasks succeeded and system state was "succeeded".
