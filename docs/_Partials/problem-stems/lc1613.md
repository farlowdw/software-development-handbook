```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Customers;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  Customers (customer_id int, customer_name varchar(20));

INSERT INTO
  Customers (customer_id, customer_name)
VALUES
  ('1', 'Alice'),
  ('4', 'Bob'),
  ('5', 'Charlie');
```

</details>

**Table:** `Customers`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```

- `customer_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the `Customers` table but are in the range between `1` and the **maximum** `customer_id` present in the table.

**Notice** that the maximum `customer_id` will not exceed `100`.

Return the result table ordered by `ids` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
```

- The maximum `customer_id` present in the table is `5`, so in the range `[1,5]`, IDs `2` and `3` are missing from the table.
