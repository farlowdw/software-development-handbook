Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a **leaf value sequence**.

</p>

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.
