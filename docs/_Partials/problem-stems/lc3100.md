You are given two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`.

`numBottles` represents the number of full water bottles that you initially have. In one operation, you can perform one of the following operations:

- Drink any number of full water bottles turning them into empty bottles.
- Exchange `numExchange` empty bottles with one full water bottle. Then, increase `numExchange` by one.

Note that you cannot exchange multiple batches of empty bottles for the same value of `numExchange`. For example, if `numBottles == 3` and `numExchange == 1`, you cannot exchange `3` empty water bottles for `3` full bottles.

Return the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink.
