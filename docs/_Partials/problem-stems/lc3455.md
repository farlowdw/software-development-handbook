You are given a string `s` and a pattern string `p`, where `p` contains exactly two `'*'` characters.

The `'*'` in `p` matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

Return the length of the shortest substring in `s` that matches `p`. If there is no such substring, return `-1`.

**Note:** The empty substring is considered valid.
