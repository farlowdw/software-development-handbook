Suppose you are given the following code:

```
class ZeroEvenOdd {
  public ZeroEvenOdd(int n) { ... }      // constructor
  public void zero(printNumber) { ... }  // only output 0's
  public void even(printNumber) { ... }  // only output even numbers
  public void odd(printNumber) { ... }   // only output odd numbers
}
```

The same instance of `ZeroEvenOdd` will be passed to three different threads:

1. Thread `A` will call `zero()` which should only output `0`'s.
2. Thread `B` will call `even()` which should only ouput even numbers.
3. Thread `C` will call `odd()` which should only output odd numbers.

Each of the threads is given a `printNumber` method to output an integer. Modify the given program to output the series `010203040506`... where the length of the series must be `2n`.
