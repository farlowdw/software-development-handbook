Given a text file `file.txt` that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: `(xxx) xxx-xxxx` or `xxx-xxx-xxxx`. (`x` means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.
