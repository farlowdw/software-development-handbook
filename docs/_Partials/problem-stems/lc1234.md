You are given a string containing only 4 kinds of characters `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.

A string is said to be **balanced** if each of its characters appears `n/4` times where `n` is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with **any** other string of the same length to make the original string `s` **balanced**.

Return `0` if the string is already **balanced**.
