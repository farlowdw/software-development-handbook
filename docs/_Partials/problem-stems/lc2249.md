Given a 2D integer array `circles` where <code>circles[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the center <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and radius <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> of the `i`th circle drawn on a grid, return the **number of lattice points** that are present inside **at least one** circle.

**Note:**

- A **lattice point** is a point with integer coordinates.
- Points that lie **on the circumference of a circle** are also considered to be inside it.
