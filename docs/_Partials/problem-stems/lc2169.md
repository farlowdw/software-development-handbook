You are given two **non-negative** integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one **operation**, if `num1 >= num2`, you must subtract `num2` from `num1`, otherwise subtract `num1` from `num2`.

- For example, if `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 4`, subtract `num2` from `num1`, thus obtaining `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 4`. However, if `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 5`, after one operation, `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 1`.

Return the **number of operations** required to make either `num1 = 0` or `num2 = 0`.
