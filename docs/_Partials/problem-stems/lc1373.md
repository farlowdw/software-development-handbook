Given a **binary tree** `root`, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of **any** sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
