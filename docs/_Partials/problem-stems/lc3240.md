You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

A row or column is considered **palindromic** if its values read the same forward and backward.

You can **flip** any number of cells in `grid` from `0` to `1`, or from `1` to `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of cells that need to be flipped to make **all** rows and columns **palindromic**, and the total number of `1`'s in `grid` **divisible** by `4`.
