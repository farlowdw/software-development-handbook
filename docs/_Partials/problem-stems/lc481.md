A magical string **S** consists of only `'1'` and `'2'` and obeys the following rules:

The string **S** is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters `'1'` and `'2'` generates the string **S** itself.

The first few elements of string **S** is the following: <code><strong>S</strong> = "1221121221221121122……"</code>

If we group the consecutive `'1'`s and `'2'`s in **S**, it will be:

```
1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......
```

and the occurrences of `'1'`s or `'2'`s in each group are:

```
1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......
```

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the **S** itself.

Given an integer `N` as input, return the number of `'1'`s in the first `N` number in the magical string **S**.

**Note:** N will not exceed `100,000`.
