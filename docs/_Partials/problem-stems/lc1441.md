Given an array `target` and an integer `n`. In each iteration, you will read a number from `list = {1,2,3..., n}`.

Build the `target` array using the following operations:

- **Push**: Read a new element from the beginning `list`, and push it in the array.
- **Pop**: delete the last element of the array.
- If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.

Return the operations to build the target array. You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.
