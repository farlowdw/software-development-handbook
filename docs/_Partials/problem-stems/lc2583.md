You are given the `root` of a binary tree and a positive integer `k`.

The **level sum** in the tree is the sum of the values of the nodes that are on the **same** level.

Return the `k`th **largest** level sum in the tree (not necessarily distinct). If there are fewer than `k` levels in the tree, return `-1`.

**Note** that two nodes are on the same level if they have the same distance from the root.
