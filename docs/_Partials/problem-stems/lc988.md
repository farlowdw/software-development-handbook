Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node has a value from `0` to `25` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`: a value of `0` represents `'a'`, a value of `1` represents `'b'`, and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, `"ab"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aba"`.  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)
