Implement the class `ProductOfNumbers` that supports two methods:

1. `add(int num)`

Adds the number `num` to the back of the current list of numbers.

2. `getProduct(int k)`

- Returns the product of the last `k` numbers in the current list.
- You can assume that always the current list has **at least** `k` numbers.

At any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.
