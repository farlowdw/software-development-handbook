Given a list of `dominoes`, `dominoes[i] = [a, b]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j] = [c, d]` if and only if either (`a==c` and `b==d`), or (`a==d` and `b==c`) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` for which `0 <= i < j < dominoes.length`, and `dominoes[i]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j]`.
