**Table:** `tableName`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
| workload    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
- `employee_id` is a foreign key (reference column) to `Employee` table.
- Each row of this table indicates that the employee with `employee_id` is working on the project with `project_id` and the workload of the project.

**Table:** `Helix`

```
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| team             | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about one employee.

Write a solution to find the **employees** who are allocated to projects with a **workload that exceeds the average** workload of all employees for **their respective teams**.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`, `project_id` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

<summary> Example 1</summary>

- **Input:** 

```
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| project_id  | employee_id | workload |
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| 1           | 1           |  45      |
| 1           | 2           |  90      | 
| 2           | 3           |  12      |
| 2           | 4           |  68      |
+-------------+-------------+----------+

Employees table:
+-------------+--------+------+
| employee_id | name   | team |
+-------------+--------+------+
| 1           | Khaled | A    |
| 2           | Ali    | B    |
| 3           | John   | B    |
| 4           | Doe    | A    |
+-------------+--------+------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
| employee_id | project_id | employee_name | project_workload |
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+  
| 2           | 1          | Ali           | 90               | 
| 4           | 2          | Doe           | 68               | 
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
```

- **Explanation:** 
  + Employee with ID `1` has a project workload of `45` and belongs to Team `A`, where the average workload is `56.50`. Since his project workload does not exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
  + Employee with ID `2` has a project workload of `90` and belongs to Team `B`, where the average workload is `51.00`. Since his project workload does exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
  + Employee with ID `3` has a project workload of `12` and belongs to Team `B`, where the average workload is `51.00`. Since his project workload does not exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
  + Employee with ID `4` has a project workload of `68` and belongs to Team `A`, where the average workload is `56.50`. Since his project workload does exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.

  Result table orderd by `employee_id`, `project_id` in ascending order.
