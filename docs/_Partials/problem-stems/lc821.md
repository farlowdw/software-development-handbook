Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return an array of integers `answer` where `answer.length == s.length` and `answer[i]` is the **distance** from index `i` to the **closest** occurrence of character `c` in `s`.

The **distance** between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs` is the absolute value function.
