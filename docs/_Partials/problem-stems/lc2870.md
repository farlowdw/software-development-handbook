You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose **two** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them from the array.
- Choose **three** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them from the array.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array empty, or `-1` if it is not possible.
