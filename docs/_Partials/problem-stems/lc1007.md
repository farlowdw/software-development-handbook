In a row of dominoes, `A[i]` and `B[i]` represent the top and bottom halves of the `i`th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from `1` to `6` - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the `i`th domino, so that `A[i]` and `B[i]` swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in `A` are the same, or all the values in `B` are the same.

If it cannot be done, return `-1`.
