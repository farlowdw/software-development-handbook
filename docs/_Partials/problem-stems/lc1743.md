There is an integer array `nums` that consists of `n` **unique** elements, but you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in `nums`.

You are given a 2D integer array `adjacentPairs` of size `n - 1` where each <code>adjacentPairs[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the elements <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> are adjacent in `nums`.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` will exist in `adjacentPairs`, either as `[nums[i], nums[i+1]]` or `[nums[i+1], nums[i]]`. The pairs can appear **in any order**.

Return *the original array `nums`. If there are multiple solutions, return **any of them***.
