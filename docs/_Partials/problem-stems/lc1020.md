You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where `0` represents a sea cell and `1` represents a land cell.

A **move** consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (**4-directionally**) land cell or walking off the boundary of the `grid`.

Return the number of land cells in `grid` for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of **moves**.
