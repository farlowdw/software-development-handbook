You are given an integer array `nums`. You can choose **exactly one** index (**0-indexed**) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.

For example, if `nums = [6,1,7,4,1]`:

- Choosing to remove index `1` results in `nums = [6,7,4,1]`.
- Choosing to remove index `2` results in `nums = [6,1,4,1]`.
- Choosing to remove index `4` results in `nums = [6,1,7,4]`.

An array is **fair** if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.

Return the **number** of indices that you could choose such that after the removal, `nums` is **fair**.
