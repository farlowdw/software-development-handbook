You are given a **0-indexed** `m * n` integer matrix `values`, representing the values of `m * n` different items in `m` different shops. Each shop has `n` items where the `j`th item in the `i`th shop has a value of `values[i][j]`. Additionally, the items in the `i`th shop are sorted in non-increasing order of value. That is, `values[i][j] >= values[i][j + 1]` for all `0 <= j < n - 1`.

On each day, you would like to buy a single item from one of the shops. Specifically, On the `d`th day you can:

- Pick any shop `i`.
- Buy the rightmost available item `j` for the price of `values[i][j] * d`. That is, find the greatest index `j` such that item `j` was never bought before, and buy it for the price of `values[i][j] * d`.

**Note** that all items are pairwise different. For example, if you have bought item `0` from shop `1`, you can still buy item `0` from any other shop.

Return the **maximum amount of money that can be spent** on buying all `m * n` products.
