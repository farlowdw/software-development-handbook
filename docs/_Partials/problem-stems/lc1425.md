Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a **non-empty** subsequence of that array such that for every two **consecutive** integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.

A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
