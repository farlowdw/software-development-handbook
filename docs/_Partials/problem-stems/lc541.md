Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and left the other as original.
