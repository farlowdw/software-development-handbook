Given a **0-indexed** 2D `grid` of size `m x n`, you should find the matrix `answer` of size `m x n`.

The value of each cell `(r, c)` of the matrix `answer` is calculated in the following way:

- Let `topLeft[r][c]` be the number of **distinct** values in the top-left diagonal of the cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `grid`.
- Let `bottomRight[r][c]` be the number of **distinct** values in the bottom-right diagonal of the cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `grid`.

Then `answer[r][c] = |topLeft[r][c] - bottomRight[r][c]|`.

Return the matrix `answer`.

A **matrix diagonal** is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end.

A cell <code>(r<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>)</code> belongs to the top-left diagonal of the cell `(r, c)`, if both belong to the same diagonal and <code>r<sub>1</sub> &lt; r</code>. Similarly is defined bottom-right diagonal.
