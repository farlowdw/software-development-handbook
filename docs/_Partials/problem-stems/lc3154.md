You are given a **non-negative** integer `k`. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the **lowest** stair numbered `0`.

Alice has an integer `jump`, with an initial value of `0`. She starts on stair `1` and wants to reach stair `k` using **any** number of **operations**. If she is on stair `i`, in one **operation** she can:

- Go down to stair `i - 1`. This operation **cannot** be used consecutively or on stair `0`.
- Go up to stair <code>i + 2<sup>jump</sup></code>. And then, `jump` becomes `jump + 1`.

Return the total number of ways Alice can reach stair `k`.

**Note** that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair `k`, and performs some operations to reach the stair `k` again.
