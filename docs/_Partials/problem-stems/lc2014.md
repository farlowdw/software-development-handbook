You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked to find the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A subsequence `seq` is **repeated** `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by concatenating `seq` `k` times.

- For example, `"bba"` is repeated `2` times in the string `"bababcba"`, because the string `"bbabba"`, constructed by concatenating `"bba"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string <code><b><u>b</u></b>a<b><u>bab</u></b>c<b><u>ba</u></b></code>.

Return the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest** one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string.
