There is a 2D grid of size `N x N` where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially **turned off**.

You are given a 2D array of lamp positions `lamps`, where <code>lamps[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the lamp at <code>grid[row<sub>i</sub>][col<sub>i</sub>]</code> is **turned on**. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.

When a lamp is turned on, it **illuminates its cell** and **all other cells** in the same **row, column, or diagonal**.

You are also given another 2D array `queries`, where <code>queries[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]</code>. For the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query, determine whether <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code> is illuminated or not. After answering the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query, **turn off** the lamp at <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code> and its **8 adjacent lamps** if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code>.

Return an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[j]` should be `1` if the cell in the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query was illuminated, or `0` if the lamp was not.
