Given an array of functions `[f1, f2, f3, ..., fn]`, return a new function `fn` that is the **function composition** of the array of functions.

The **function composition** of `[f(x), g(x), h(x)]` is `fn(x) = f(g(h(x)))`.

The **function composition** of an empty list of functions is the **identity function** `f(x) = x`.

You may assume each function in the array accepts one integer as input and returns one integer as output.
