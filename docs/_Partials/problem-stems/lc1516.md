Given the `root` of an [N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/introduction-to-n-ary-trees/) of unique values, and two nodes of the tree `p` and `q`.

You should move the subtree of the node `p` to become a direct child of node `q`. If `p` is already a direct child of `q`, don't change anything. Node `p` **must be** the last child in the children list of node `q`.

Return the root of the tree after adjusting it.

There are 3 cases for nodes `p` and `q`:

1. Node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.
2. Node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q`.
3. Neither node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q` nor node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.

In cases 2 and 3, you just need to move `p` (with its sub-tree) to be a child of `q`, but in case 1 the tree may be disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again. **Please read the examples carefully before solving this problem.**

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

For example, the above tree is serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.
