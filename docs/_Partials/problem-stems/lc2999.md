You are given three integers `start`, `finish`, and `limit`. You are also given a **0-indexed** string `s` representing a **positive** integer.

A **positive** integer `x` is called **powerful** if it ends with `s` (in other words, `s` is a **suffix** of `x`) and each digit in `x` is at most `limit`.

Return the **total** number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]`.

A string `x` is a suffix of a string `y` if and only if `x` is a substring of `y` that starts from some index (**including** `0`) in `y` and extends to the index `y.length - 1`. For example, `25` is a suffix of `5125` whereas `512` is not.
