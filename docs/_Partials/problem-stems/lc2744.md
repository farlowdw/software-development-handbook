You are given a **0-indexed** array `words` consisting of **distinct** strings.

The string `words[i]` can be paired with the string `words[j]` if:

- The string `words[i]` is equal to the reversed string of `words[j]`.
- `0 <= i < j < words.length`

Return the **maximum** number of pairs that can be formed from the array `words`.

Note that each string can belong in **at most one** pair.
