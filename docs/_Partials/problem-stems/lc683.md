You have `n` bulbs in a row numbered from `1` to `n`. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. We turn on **exactly one** bulb every day until all bulbs are on after `n` days.

You are given an array `bulbs` of length `n` where `bulbs[i] = x` means that on the <code>(i+1)<sup>th</sup></code> day, we will turn on the bulb at position `x` where `i` is **0-indexed** and `x` is **1-indexed**.

Given an integer `k`, return the **minimum day number** such that there exists two **turned on** bulbs that have **exactly** `k` bulbs between them that are **all turned off**. If there isn't such day, return `-1`.
