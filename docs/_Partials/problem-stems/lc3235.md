You are given two positive integers `xCorner` and `yCorner`, and a 2D array `circles`, where <code>circles[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a circle with center at <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and radius <code>r<sub>i</sub></code>.

There is a rectangle in the coordinate plane with its bottom left corner at the origin and top right corner at the coordinate `(xCorner, yCorner)`. You need to check whether there is a path from the bottom left corner to the top right corner such that the **entire path** lies inside the rectangle, **does not** touch or lie inside **any** circle, and touches the rectangle **only** at the two corners.

Return `true` if such a path exists, and `false` otherwise.
