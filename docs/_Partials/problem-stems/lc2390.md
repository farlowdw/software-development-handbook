You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after **all** stars have been removed.

**Note:**

- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.
