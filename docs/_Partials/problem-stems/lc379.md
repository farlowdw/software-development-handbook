Design a phone directory that initially has `maxNumbers` empty slots that can store numbers. The directory should store numbers, check if a certain slot is empty or not, and empty a given slot.

Implement the `PhoneDirectory` class:

- `PhoneDirectory(int maxNumbers)` Initializes the phone directory with the number of available slots `maxNumbers`.
- `int get()` Provides a number that is not assigned to anyone. Returns `-1` if no number is available.
- `bool check(int number)` Returns `true` if the slot `number` is available and `false` otherwise.
- `void release(int number)` Recycles or releases the slot `number`.
