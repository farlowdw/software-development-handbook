You are given an array `target` that consists of **distinct** integers and another integer array `arr` that **can** have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in arr. For example, if `arr = [1,4,1,2]`, you can add `3` in the middle and make it <code>[1,4,<u>3</u>,1,2]</code>. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.

Return the **minimum** number of operations needed to make `target` a **subsequence** of `arr`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of <code>[4,<u>2</u>,3,<u>7</u>,2,1,<u>4</u>]</code> (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.
