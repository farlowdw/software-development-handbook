You are given a **0-indexed** array of string `words` and two integers `left` and `right`.

A string is called a **vowel string** if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

Return the number of vowel strings `words[i]` where `i` belongs to the inclusive range `[left, right]`.
