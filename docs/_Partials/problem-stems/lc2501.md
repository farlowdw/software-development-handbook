You are given an integer array `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is called a **square streak** if:

- The length of the subsequence is at least `2`, and
- **after** sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the **square** of the previous number.

Return the length of the **longest square streak** in `nums`, or return `-1` if there is no **square streak**.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
