Given an equation, represented by `words` on left side and the `result` on right side.

You need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:

- Each character is decoded as one digit (`0 - 9`).
- Every pair of different characters they must map to different digits.
- Each `words[i]` and `result` are decoded as one number **without** leading zeros.
- Sum of numbers on left side (`words`) will equal to the number on right side (`result`). 

Return `True` if the equation is solvable otherwise return `False`.
