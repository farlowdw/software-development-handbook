You are given a binary array `pattern` and an object `stream` of class `InfiniteStream` representing a **0-indexed** infinite stream of bits.

The class `InfiniteStream` contains the following function:

- `int next()`: Reads a **single** bit (which is either `0` or `1`) from the stream and returns it.

Return the **first starting** index where the pattern matches the bits read from the stream. For example, if the pattern is `[1, 0]`, the first match is the highlighted part in the stream <code>[0, <u>1, 0</u>, 1, ...]</code>.
