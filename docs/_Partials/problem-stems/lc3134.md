You are given an integer array `nums`. The **uniqueness array** of `nums` is the sorted array that contains the number of distinct elements of all the subarrays of `nums`. In other words, it is a sorted array consisting of `distinct(nums[i..j])`, for all `0 <= i <= j < nums.length`.

Here, `distinct(nums[i..j])` denotes the number of distinct elements in the subarray that starts at index `i` and ends at index `j`.

Return the **median** of the **uniqueness array** of `nums`.

**Note** that the **median** of an array is defined as the middle element of the array when it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If there are two choices for a median, the **smaller** of the two values is taken.
