Given 2 integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` consisting only of `0` and `1`, your task is to calculate the **minimum** possible **largest** number in arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, after doing the following.

Replace every `0` with an *even positive integer* and every `1` with an *odd positive integer*. After replacement, both arrays should be **increasing** and each integer should be used **at most** once.

Return the minimum possible largest number after applying the changes.
