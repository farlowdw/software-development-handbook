You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of size `n` consisting of **non-negative** integers.

You need to apply `n - 1` operations to this array where, in the `i`th operation (**0-indexed**), you will apply the following on the `i`th element of `nums`:

- If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`, then multiply `nums[i]` by `2` and set `nums[i + 1]` to `0`. Otherwise, you skip this operation.

After performing **all** the operations, **shift** all the `0`'s to the **end** of the array.

- For example, the array `[1,0,2,0,0,1]` after shifting all its `0`'s to the end, is `[1,2,1,0,0,0]`.

Return the resulting array.

**Note** that the operations are applied **sequentially**, not all at once.
