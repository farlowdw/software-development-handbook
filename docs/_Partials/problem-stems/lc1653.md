You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`.

You can delete any number of characters in `s` to make `s` **balanced**. `s` is **balanced** if there is no pair of indices `(i,j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] = 'b'` and `s[j]= 'a'`.

Return the **minimum** number of deletions needed to make `s` **balanced**.
