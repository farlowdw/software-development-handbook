You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

In one operation, you can choose **any** row or column and flip each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all `0`'s to `1`'s, and all `1`'s to `0`'s).

Return `true` if it is possible to remove all `1`'s from `grid` using **any** number of operations or `false` otherwise.
