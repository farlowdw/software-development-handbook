You are given a string `s` of **even length** consisting of digits from `0` to `9`, and two integers `a` and `b`.

You can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any order on `s`:

- Add `a` to all odd indices of `s` (**0-indexed**). Digits post `9` are cycled back to `0`. For example, if `s = "3456"` and `a = 5`, `s` becomes `"3951"`.
- Rotate `s` to the right by `b` positions. For example, if `s = "3456"` and `b = 1`, `s` becomes `"6345"`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on `s`.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. For example, `"0158"` is lexicographically smaller than `"0190"` because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and `'5'` comes before `'9'`.
