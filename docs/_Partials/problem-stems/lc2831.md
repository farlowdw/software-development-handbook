You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

A subarray is called **equal** if all of its elements are equal. Note that the empty subarray is an **equal** subarray.

Return the length of the **longest** possible equal subarray after deleting **at most** `k` elements from `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous, possibly empty sequence of elements within an array.
