You are given an integer array `nums` and three integers `k`, `op1`, and `op2`.

You can perform the following operations on `nums`:

- **Operation 1:** Choose an index `i` and divide `nums[i]` by `2`, **rounding up** to the nearest whole number. You can perform this operation at most `op1` times, and not more than **once** per index.
- **Operation 2:** Choose an index `i` and subtract `k` from `nums[i]`, but only if `nums[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`. You can perform this operation at most `op2` times, and not more than **once** per index.

**Note:** Both operations can be applied to the same index, but at most once each.

Return the **minimum** possible **sum** of all elements in **nums** after performing any number of operations.
