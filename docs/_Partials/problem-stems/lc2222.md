You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` which represents the types of buildings along a street where:

- `s[i] = '0'` denotes that the `i`th building is an office and
- `s[i] = '1'` denotes that the `i`th building is a restaurant.

As a city official, you would like to **select** 3 buildings for random inspection. However, to ensure variety, **no two consecutive** buildings out of the **selected** buildings can be of the same type.

- For example, given <code>s = "0<b><u>0</u></b>1<b><u>1</u></b>0<b><u>1</u></b>"</code>, we cannot select the 1st, 3rd, and 5th buildings as that would form <code>"0<b><u>11</u></b>"</code> which is **not** allowed due to having two consecutive buildings of the same type.

Return the **number of valid ways** to select 3 buildings.
