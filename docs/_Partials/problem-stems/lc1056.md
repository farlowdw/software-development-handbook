Given a number `N`, return `true` if and only if it is a confusing number, which satisfies the following condition:

We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. When 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid. A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a **different** number with each digit valid.
