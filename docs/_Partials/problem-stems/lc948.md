You have an initial **power** of `P`, an initial **score** of `0`, and a bag of `tokens` where `tokens[i]` is the value of the `i`th token (0-indexed).

Your goal is to maximize your total **score** by potentially playing each token in one of two ways:

- If your current **power** is at least `tokens[i]`, you may play the `i`th token face up, losing `tokens[i]` **power** and gaining `1` **score**.
- If your current **score** is at least `1`, you may play the `i`th token face down, gaining `tokens[i]` power and losing `1` **score**.

Each token may be played **at most** once and **in any order**. You do **not** have to play all the tokens.

Return the largest possible **score** you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
