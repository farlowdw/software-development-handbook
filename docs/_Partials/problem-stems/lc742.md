Given a binary tree **where every node has a unique value**, and a target key `k`, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target `k` in the tree.

Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual `root` tree given will be a TreeNode object.
