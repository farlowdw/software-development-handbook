You are given a **0-indexed** array `words` containing `n` strings.

Let's define a **join** operation `join(x, y)` between two strings `x` and `y` as concatenating them into `xy`. However, if the last character of `x` is equal to the first character of `y`, one of them is **deleted**.

For example `join("ab", "ba") = "aba"` and `join("ab", "cde") = "abcde"`.

You are to perform `n - 1` **join** operations. Let <code>str<sub>0</sub> = words[0]</code>. Starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n - 1`, for the `i`th operation, you can do one of the following:

- Make <code>str<sub>i</sub> = join(str<sub>i-1</sub>, words[i])</code>
- Make <code>str<sub>i</sub> = join(words[i], str<sub>i-1</sub>)</code>

Your task is to **minimize** the length of <code>str<sub>n-1</sub></code>.

Return an integer denoting the minimum possible length of <code>str<sub>n-1</sub></code>.
