There is a large `(m - 1) x (n - 1)` rectangular field with corners at `(1, 1)` and `(m, n)` containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays `hFences` and `vFences` respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates `(hFences[i], 1)` to `(hFences[i], n)` and vertical fences are from the coordinates `(1, vFences[i])` to `(m, vFences[i])`.

Return the **maximum** area of a **square** field that can be formed by **removing** some fences (**possibly none**) or `-1` if it is impossible to make a square field.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

**Note:** The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates `(1, 1)` to `(1, n)` and `(m, 1)` to `(m, n)` and two vertical fences from the coordinates `(1, 1)` to `(m, 1)` and `(1, n)` to `(m, n)`. These fences **cannot** be removed.
