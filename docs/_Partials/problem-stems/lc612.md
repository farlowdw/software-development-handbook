```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS point_2d;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  point_2d (x INT NOT NULL, y INT NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO
  point_2d (x, y)
VALUES
  ('-1', '-1'),
  ('0', '0'),
  ('-1', '-2');
```

</details>

Table `point_2d` holds the coordinates `(x,y)` of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

```
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
```

The shortest distance is `1.00` from point `(-1,-1)` to `(-1,2)`. So the output should be:

```
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
```

**Note:** The longest distance among all the points are less than `10000`.
