```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Employee;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (id int, salary int);

INSERT INTO
  Employee (id, salary) 
VALUES 
  ('1', '100'),
  ('2', '200'),
  ('3', '300');
```

</details>

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

<details open><summary> Example 1</summary>

- **Input:** 

```
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

- **Explanation:** Given the above `Employee` table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

- **Input:** 

```
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
```

- **Output:** 

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

:::caution Ambiguity with Ties 

As the problem on LeetCode currently stands, it is somewhat ambiguous. For example, if the `Employee` table only had two records with the same value for `salary`, what should our query return? A `NULL` value or one of the two identical values? Hence, for the sake of clarity, assume that in the situation described above you would return `NULL`; that is, assume the rankings for salaries concerns rankings among *distinct* salaries.
