Given a matrix of integers `A` with `R` rows and `C` columns, find the **maximum** score of a path starting at `[0,0]` and ending at `[R-1,C-1]`.

The score of a path is the **minimum** value in that path.  For example, the value of the path `8 → 4 → 5 → 9` is `4`.

A path moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west, south).
