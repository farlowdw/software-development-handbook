You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `i`th worker.

You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:

- You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
- In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
  + For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4`th worker because they have the lowest cost <code>[<u>3</u>,<u>2</u>,7,7,<b><u>1</u></b>,<u>2</u>]</code>.
  + In the second hiring session, we will choose `1`st worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4`th worker but they have the smallest index <code>[<u>3</u>,<b><u>2</u></b>,7,<u>7</u>,<u>2</u>]</code>. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
- If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- A worker can only be chosen once.

Return the total cost to hire exactly `k` workers.
