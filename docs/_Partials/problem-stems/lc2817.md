You are given a `0-indexed` integer array `nums` and an integer `x`.

Find the **minimum absolute difference** between two elements in the array that are at least `x` indices apart.

In other words, find two indices `i` and `j` such that `abs(i - j) >= x` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j])` is minimized.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** absolute difference between two elements that are at least `x` indices apart.
