Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

You are given a string `num` of **even length** consisting of digits and `'?'` characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one `'?'` in `num`:

1. Choose an index `i` where `num[i] == '?'`.
2. Replace `num[i]` with any digit between `'0'` and `'9'`.

The game ends when there are no more `'?'` characters in `num`.

For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of `num` must be **equal** to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must **not be equal**.

- For example, if the game ended with `num = "243801"`, then Bob wins because `2+4+3 = 8+0+1`. If the game ended with `num = "243803"`, then Alice wins because `2+4+3 != 8+0+3`.

Assuming Alice and Bob play **optimally**, return `true` if Alice will win and `false` if Bob will win.
