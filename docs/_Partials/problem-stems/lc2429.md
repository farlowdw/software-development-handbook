Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find the integer `x` such that:

- `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and
- The value `x XOR num1` is **minimal**.

Note that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the integer `x`. The test cases are generated such that `x` is **uniquely determined**.

The number of **set bits** of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.
