You are given a list of blocks, where `blocks[i] = t` means that the `i`th block needs `t` units of time to be built. A block can only be built by exactly one worker.

A worker can either split into two workers (number of workers increases by one) or build a block then go home. Both decisions cost some time.

The time cost of spliting one worker into two workers is given as an integer `split`. Note that if two workers split at the same time, they split in parallel so the cost would be `split`.

Output the minimum time needed to build all blocks.

Initially, there is only **one** worker.
