You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.

Remove `list1`'s nodes from the `a`th node to the `b`th node, and put `list2` in their place.

The blue edges and nodes in the following figure incidate the result:

<p align='center'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/lc/1669-f1.png').default} />
</p>

Build the result list and return its head.
