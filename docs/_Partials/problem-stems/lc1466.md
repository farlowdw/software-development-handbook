There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a road from city `a` to `b`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach the city `0` after reorder.
