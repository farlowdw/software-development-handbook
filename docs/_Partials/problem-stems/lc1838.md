The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most** `k` operations.
