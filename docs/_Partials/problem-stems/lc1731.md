DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Employees;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 
  Employees (employee_id int, name varchar(20), reports_to int, age int);

INSERT INTO 
  Employees (employee_id, name, reports_to, age)
VALUES 
  ('9', 'Hercy', NULL, '43'),
  ('6', 'Alice', '9', '41'),
  ('4', 'Bob', '9', '36'),
  ('2', 'Winston', NULL, '37');

**Table:** `Employees`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
```

- `employee_id` is the primary key for this table.
- This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (`reports_to` is `null`). 

For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+

Result table:
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
```

Hercy has `2` people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is `(41+36)/2 = 38.5`, which is `39` after rounding it to the nearest integer.
