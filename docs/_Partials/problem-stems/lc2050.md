You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where <code>relations[j] = [prevCourse<sub>j</sub>, nextCourse<sub>j</sub>]</code> denotes that course <code>prevCourse<sub>j</sub></code> has to be completed **before** course <code>nextCourse<sub>j</sub></code> (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a **0-indexed** integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many **months** it takes to complete the `(i+1)`th course.

You must find the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:

- You may start taking a course at **any time** if the prerequisites are met.
- **Any number of courses** can be taken at the **same time**.

Return the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses.

**Note:** The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).
