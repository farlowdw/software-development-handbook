You are given a positive integer `n`, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for <code>10<sup>9</sup></code> days, you perform the following procedure:

- For each number `x` present on the board, find all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1`.
- Then, place those numbers on the board.

Return the number of **distinct** integers present on the board after <code>10<sup>9</sup></code> days have elapsed.

**Note:**

- Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
- `%` stands for the modulo operation. For example, `14 % 3` is `2`.
