You are given an array `points` where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the coordinates of a point on an infinite plane.

Your task is to find the **maximum** area of a rectangle that:

- Can be formed using **four** of these points as its corners.
- Does **not** contain any other point inside or on its border.
- Has its edges **parallel** to the axes.

Return the **maximum area** that you can obtain or `-1` if no such rectangle is possible.
