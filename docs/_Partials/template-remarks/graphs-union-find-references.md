This can be a rather confusing data structure at first. The [Algorithms with Attitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axaOsCgpupk&list=PLSVu1-lON6LwGquZz42Mnf9qiJ1hvZxTf&index=3) YouTube channel has a good introduction video to this structure &#8212; he uses union by size when most people use union by rank, but the differences are not large (the other remarks on this page show how these approaches differ). The most helpful part of this video is how he describes *path compression*, namely as a way of "not being stupid" when executing a `find` &#8212; we update node representatives when trying to find a given node so as not to repeat all of our search work when trying to find the same node again (the updates of pointing each node along the path to the root *is* path compression).

Illustrative pictures are provided in <BibRef id='DPV' pages='pp. 132-137'></BibRef> as well. It's probably most helpful to watch the video linked above and *then* watch the [path compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHRhJWacxis) video by William Fiset. It helps to *see* how the compression actually works. Following up the compression video with Fiset's description of [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZBQLXgSGfs) is a great idea to see the union-find structure in action (Kruskal's Algorithm is a classic example of where the union-find structure shines).
