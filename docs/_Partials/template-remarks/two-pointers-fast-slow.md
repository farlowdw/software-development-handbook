The "fast and slow" template provided below is *not* for problems involving linked lists but for other commonly encountered problems where the iterable given is an array, string (array of characters), etc. The idea is that the fast pointer steadily advances while the slow pointer is only advanced in a piecemeal fashion (often after some sort of condition is met).
