- **Window size greater than array size (possibility):** There is a chance that the window size `k` is greater than the array size `arr.length` &#8212; if not properly accounted for, this could easily lead to index out of range errors (it's not accounted for in the pseudocode below). It is often not a bad idea to have a check for this before proceeding with the window creation operation.
- **Clarity:** Method 1 appears to be somewhat cleaner than Method 2 despite having another `for` loop. The construction of the window and initialization of `ans` is unambiguous and easy to understand in Method 1. We start by building the window, we set the initial answer, and then we move the window while iteratively updating the answer. It's easier to keep things clear and straight with this approach.
