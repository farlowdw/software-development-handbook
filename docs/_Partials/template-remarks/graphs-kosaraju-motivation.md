The motivation for Kosaraju's algorithm for finding strongly connected components (SCCs), as described below, is largely inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOmetF56BI&list=PLSVu1-lON6LyvT8iceopuqnmSmPiSA6wX&index=4). My goal here is mostly to provide more explanations and working code.
