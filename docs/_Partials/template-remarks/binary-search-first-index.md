This template will return the first index where `target` is encountered. If duplicates are present, then the index returned is effectively random (i.e., the `target` matched/identified by means of the search could be neither the leftmost occurrence nor the rightmost occurrence but somewhere in between). If no match is found, then the return value, `left`, will point to the insertion point where `target` would need to be inserted in order to maintain the sorted property of `arr`.
