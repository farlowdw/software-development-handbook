- **Window size greater than array size (possibility):** There is a chance that the window size `k` is greater than the array size `arr.length` &#8212; if not properly accounted for, this could easily lead to index out of range errors (it's not accounted for in the pseudocode below). It is often not a bad idea to have a check for this before proceeding with the window creation operation.
- **Initialization of `ans`:** Sometimes it can be a little unclear as to how best to initialize the `ans` variable. For example, in <LC id='643' type='' ></LC> we are looking for a "maximum average subarray" which means initializing `ans` to, say, `0` does not make sense because the maximum average could be negative depending on what elements are present in the array. It makes more sense in this problem to have `ans = float('-inf')` as the initialization even though it does not feel all that natural.
- **Complicated logic:** The logic for managing the window is actually a bit more complicated than that used in Method 1. Here, in Method 2, the window is really being constructed by adding `arr[i]` to the window *until* `i == k`. If our array only has `k` elements, then our updating of `ans` before we return can save us from possible errors, but the whole thing takes a bit more effort to wrap your head around.
