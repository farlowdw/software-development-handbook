Imagine you're a tourist visiting a town rapidly growing in popularity. This town has several attractions, and you want to start by seeing *the* the main one (root). In an effort to help tourists plan their sightseeing effectively, town leadership organized the attractions in such a way that subsequent attractions are usually recommended once a tourist has finished visiting the current attraction. Any given attraction will recommend either no subsequent attraction (a leaf), a single subsequent attraction, or two subsequent attractions. If two subsequent attractions are recommended, then one will be a primary attraction (left child) and the other a secondary attraction (right child). You want to see as many primary attractions as you can, starting at the main primary attraction, before moving on to secondary attractions, but you want to see them all.

Here's the process you will follow in order to accomplish this:

1. **Step 1 (start seeing attractions):** Begin your sightseeing journey by visiting the town's main attraction (visit the root).
2. **Step 2 (note the recommendations):** If the attraction you just visited recommends another attraction (not a leaf), then make a note of this (push to the stack).
3. **Step 3 (visit primary attractions first and as encountered):** Before exploring the town any further and visiting other attractions, always immediately visit the recommended primary attraction (left child) if it exists.
4. **Step 4 (note secondary attractions):** If the attraction you just visited recommends a secondary attraction (right child), then note this secondary attraction for visiting later (push to the stack), but continue on your current path.
5. **Step 5 (use your notes to visit more attractions):** Once you have finished seeing as many consecutive primary attractions as you can, consult your notes and follow your most recent note about secondary attractions that you've made.
6. **Step 6 (finish seeing attractions):** Continue the pattern of visiting primary attractions as you encounter them and noting down secondary attractions for future visitations until you have explored all attractions in the town.

We can annotate the previously provided Python code to illustrate the steps above (the highlighted line simply serves to show where the logic would be included to process the current node):

```python
def preorder_iterative_LR(node):
    # (in case there is no main attraction)
    if not node:
        return
    
    stack = []
    stack.append(node)  # Step 1: Start seeing attractions
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()  # Step 3 or 5: Visit primary attraction (Step 3) OR 
                            # check most recent note for secondary attraction (Step 5)
        
        # highlight-next-line
        visit(node)         # Visit the current attraction (process current node)
        
        # Step 4: Note the recommended secondary attraction (if it exists)
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        
        # Step 2: Note the recommended primary attraction (if it exists)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
```

Note that since stacks are fundamentally LIFO structures (i.e., last in first out) we want to push primary attraction recommendations to the stack *after* secondary attraction recommendations. This ensures we always get the primary attraction recommendation when we pop from the stack.

This analogy makes it clear the tourist focuses on the primary attractions but neither loses sight of nor forgets the secondary attractions thanks to the notes taken after visiting each attraction (i.e., pushing to the stack).
