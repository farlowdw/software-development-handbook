This problem is difficult. And it's often used to explain backtracking at various learning levels (e.g., university and college classes). The solution to this problem is informative, especially in regards to how we might want to go about modeling backtracking solutions to other problems.

Whenver we make a call to `backtrack`, we're doing so by describing the *state* of whatever it is that is important for consideration in solving the problem at hand. For some problems, maybe that state involves a string and the number of used left and right parentheses (e.g., <LC id='22' type='long' ></LC>), maybe the state involves the row and column of a grid under consideration along with the cells already seen and the index of a word that represents a character for which we are searching (e.g., <LC id='79' type='long' ></LC>). And maybe, as in this problem, the state needs to involve a chessboard!

What state should we consider tracking? We need to somehow keep track of rows and columns in some way. The trickier part about this problem involves the diagonals. Even though we have a *board* in this problem, this is not like a graph problem where we need to conduct a DFS or BFS &#8212; fundamentally, our job at each step is to place a queen on the board so that it is not under attack. This is the backtracking part where we narrow down the range of possibilities we consider &#8212; the brute force approach would involve generating all board possibilities with queens and then narrow down which solutions actually work, but that would involve placing queens on the board in positions that *are* being attacked, which means the rest of the generation of possibilities is useless. We want to place queens in positions where they are not being attacked and where whatever subsequent positions we consider can actually lead to a solution. Only once we find a solution do we start to undo queen placement and try *other* queen placements, but the key is that every placement must be one that could potentially lead to success.

With everything in mind above, how should we proceed? First, it's helpful to just think about how queens move on a chessboard: unlimited moves vertically, horizontally, diagonally (top left to bottom right), and anti-diagonally (top right to bottom left). If we are given `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard, then it's clear that, at the end of the board configuration, each row must have a queen and each column must have a queen. The trickiest part is managing the diagonals effectively.

But we can start by working with the insight above about rows and columns. Each time `backtrack` is called should result in the placement of a queen on a new row; that is, we'll pass `row` as an argument to `backtrack`, and when we have finally reached `row == n` (i.e., rows `0` through `n - 1` have been filled with queens), then we will know we have found a valid solution. Finding a workable position on any given row means processing all column positions on that row until we have found a position that is not under attack.

What about columns? As noted above, for each row being processed, we will iterate through all row positions (i.e., across all columns) until we find a column position that is not under attack. The row we are processing is definitely not under attack due to how we're processing rows, but how do we know whether or not each column is under attack? If another queen is on any column we're considering for a current row, then that column position is invalid because that other queen's line of attack runs through the current position we're considering. We need to consider the next column position. To keep track of which columns are already occupied by queens (i.e., which columns would be considered to be under attack when we're trying to add a new queen), whenever we add a queen to the board, we should add the column position of the queen to a set `cols` that we can use when we're trying to add subsequent queens.

Cool! We consider rows sequentially so it's guaranteed each row we're considering is not under attack. We have a set `cols` that shows which columns are occupied. It seems like we need a similar "strategy" for diagonals and anti-diagonals that we currently have for columns; that is, whenever we add a queen to the board, we should also note which diagonal and anti-diagonal just became occupied. But how do we effectively apply a singular label or marker to a diagonal or anti-diagonal that spans multiple positions on the board?

This seems really tricky to do at first until we make note of a brilliant observation concerning diagonal and anti-diagonal movement (`R` and `C` below represent row and column position, respectively):

- diagonal movement (top left to bottom right): If we start at *any* cell `(R, C)` and move *one* position up, then we will be at cell `(R - 1, C - 1)`. If we move one position down, then we will be at `(R + 1, C + 1)`. In general, if we let `dr` and `dc` represent the change in row or column value, respectively, then we will find ourselves always moving from cell `(R, C)` to `(R + dr, C + dc)` on a given diagonal. Importantly, note that `dr == dc` since a change in any direction effects each value in the same way (e.g., moving 4 spaces up means `dr == dc == -4` since the row and column values both decrease by 4).

  But how does any of this help in service of creating a unique label for a diagonal? The insight lies in how the row and column values relate to each other. Let `(R, C)` be the coordinates of a cell on a diagonal, and let's *label* the cell as having value `R - C`. Then what happens whenever we move from cell `(R, C)` to cell `(R + dr, C + dc)`? Since `dr == dc`, we have `(R + dr) - (C + dc) =  R + dr - C - dr = R - C`; that is, the *label* for any cell on a diagonal is the same:

  <div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
    <img width='375px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/backtracking/f3.png').default} />
  </div>

  Hence, we should label visited diagonals by adding `row - col` values to a `diagonals` set.

- anti-diagonal movement (top right to bottom left): We can make a similar argument to the one above about effectively labeling anti-diagonals. Let `(R, C)` represent any given cell on an anti-diagonal. Then moving up a cell would take us to cell `(R - 1, C + 1)` while moving down a cell would take us to cell `(R + 1, C - 1)`; that is, the row and column values of a cell change at the same rate in an inversely proportional manner. We essentially have `dr == dc` again, but there needs to be a sign difference in how we represent a movement from `(R, C)` to another cell: `(R + dr, C - dc)`. Then `(R + dr) + (C - dc) = R + dr + C - dr = R + C`:

  <div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
    <img width='375px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/backtracking/f4.png').default} />
  </div>

  Hence, we should label visited anti-diagonals by adding `row + col` values to an `anti-diagonals` set.
