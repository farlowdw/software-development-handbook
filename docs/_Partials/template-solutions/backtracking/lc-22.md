                valid_parens.append("".join(curr_str))
                return
                
            if left_count < n:
                curr_str.append('(')
                backtrack(curr_str, left_count + 1, right_count)
                curr_str.pop()
            
            if left_count > right_count:
                curr_str.append(')')
                backtrack(curr_str, left_count, right_count + 1)
                curr_str.pop()

The [editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/solution/) for this solution on LeetCode is quite good. The key insights (with the first being somewhat minor but the second one being critical):

- We should append the string we're building whenever its length is `2n` because the string we're building, when taking a backtracking approach anyway, must have the potential to be valid and a complete solution *at every point*. Hence, once/if the candidate string reaches a length of `2n`, then we know the string satisfies the constraints of the problem and is a complete solution.
- As a starting point, we can add as many left-parentheses as we want without fear of producing an invalid string (so long as the number of left parentheses we add doesn't exceed `n`). We then need to start adding right parentheses. But how can we add right parentheses in general? We should only ever consider adding a right parenthesis when the total number of left parentheses *exceeds* the number of right parentheses. That way when we add a right parenthesis there's a chance the subsequent string could be a well-formed parenthetical string of length `2n`, as desired.

The LeetCode editorial linked above shows how sketching out a tree of possibilities is very useful for this problem, where the following illustration is for the beginning of the case where `n = 2`:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='575px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/backtracking/f5.png').default} />
</div>

We can start to see how the logic of the solution above makes sense. For the sake of completeness and concreteness, consider the input of the first example on LeetCode, `n = 3`, and the corresponding desired output:

```
["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

We can make our own diagram that shows how each solution is built (the `x` indicates that potential solution path is longer pursued since further work on that path cannot possibly lead to a correct answer):

As a note of reference, the tree above was generated using the `binarytree` package:

```python
from binarytree import build2
my_tree = build2([

    "((", "()", None, None,
    "(((", "(()", "()(", "x",

    None, None, "x", "((()))", None, None, "x", "(()())", "x", "(())()", None, None, None, None, "x", "()(())", "x", "()()()"
])

root = my_tree.levelorder[0]
print(root)
