```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []
        
        keypad = {
            '2': 'abc',
            '3': 'def',
            '4': 'ghi',
            '5': 'jkl',
            '6': 'mno',
            '7': 'pqrs',
            '8': 'tuv',
            '9': 'wxyz'
        }
        
        def backtrack(curr, start_idx):
            if len(curr) == len(digits):
                combinations.append("".join(curr))
                return
            
            for i in range(start_idx, len(digits)):
                digit = digits[i]
                for letter in keypad[digit]:
                    curr.append(letter)
                    backtrack(curr, i + 1)
                    curr.pop()
            
        combinations = []
        backtrack([], 0)
        
        return combinations
```

As with most other backtracking problems, it helps if we start by sketching out the tree of possibilities, where we can imagine the root being an empty string:

```
''
```

Now let's consider the input `digits = "23"`, the input for the first example on LeetCode. The desired output is `["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]`. How can this be achieved? The first digit is `2`, which means `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` are valid starting letters for combinations:

```
      ' '
   /   |   \
 'a'  'b'  'c'
```

We do not want to add duplicates of these letters for subsequent possible combinations but instead consider the potential letters arising from the *next* digit (i.e., we want to prevent processing duplicates by only ever processing digits *after* the current digit). The next digit in this case is `3` which corresponds to possible letters `'d'`, `'e'`, and `'f'`. Our tree now looks like the following:

```
                   ' '
        /           |           \
      'a'          'b'          'c'
    /  |  \      /  |  \      /  |  \
  'd' 'e' 'f'  'd' 'e' 'f'  'd' 'e' 'f'
```

The tree of possibilities above makes it clear the letter combinations we should return are as follows, as expected:

```python
[
  'ad',
  'ae',
  'af',
  'bd',
  'be',
  'bf',
  'cd',
  'ce',
  'cf',
]
```
