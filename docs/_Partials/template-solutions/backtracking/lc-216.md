```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def backtrack(nums_arr, curr_sum, next_num):
            if len(nums_arr) == k and curr_sum == n:
                res.append(nums_arr[:])
                return
            
            for num in range(next_num, 10):
                if curr_sum + num <= n:
                    nums_arr.append(num)
                    backtrack(nums_arr, curr_sum + num, num + 1)
                    nums_arr.pop()
            
        res = []
        backtrack([], 0, 1)
        
        return res

The valid combinations can only involve positive integers, which means the sum we're building can only get bigger. Hence, we should only consider as possibilities combinations of integers for which the sum does not exceed `n`. Also, the numbers used as part of the combination need to be unique. Which means whenever we start with a certain number we should only ever consider subsequent integer values.
