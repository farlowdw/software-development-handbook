        def backtrack(curr, num_idx):
            subs.append(curr[:])
            
            if num_idx == len(nums):      # note that this base case is implied
                return                    # since `backtrack` is only called in the 
                                          # for loop when `num_idx < len(nums)`
            
            for i in range(num_idx, len(nums)):
                curr.append(nums[i])
                backtrack(curr, i + 1)
                curr.pop()
                
        subs = []
        backtrack([], 0)
        
        return subs
```

This problem is quite similar to <LC id='46' type='long' ></LC> but with some very notable differences, namely container *length* and element *order*:

- **Length:** A subset can have any length from `0` through `n` (where `n` is the size of the input array of distinct integers), inclusive, but a permutation has a fixed length of `n`.
- **Order:** The containers `[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 2, 1]` are considered to be *different* permutations but the same subset.

If we have a problem where containers like those above are considered to be duplicates and we do not want to consider duplicates (e.g., such as this problem concerned with finding subsets), then a common "trick" is to add a rule where each call of the `backtrack` function allows us to only consider elements that come *after* the previously processed element:

> This is a very common method of avoiding duplicates in backtracking problems &#8212; have an integer argument that represents a starting point for iteration at each function call.

For example, in this problem, we start with the root being the empty container, `[]`:

```
[]
```

With `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, we can clearly consider each element as the beginning of its own subset:

```
     [ ]
  /   |   \
[1]  [2]  [3]
```

Now what? Remember that calling `backtrack` is like moving to another node; hence, to respect the strategy remarked on above, when we move to another node, that node should only involve elements that come *after* the one we have just processed. This means the tree of possibilities above should end up looking like the following:

```
         [ ]          # level subsets: []
    /     |     \
  [1]    [2]    [3]   # level subsets: [1], [2], [3]
  / \     |
[2] [3]  [3]          # level subsets: [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]
 |
[3]                   # level subsets: [1,2,3]
```

The actual order of subset generation from our solution code is not hard to anticipate in light of the strategy we've been discussing, where, again, we're basically doing a DFS on an imaginary tree, and once we hit the last indexed element (i.e., when `index == len(nums)`) we move back up the tree from child to parent:

```python
[
  [],
  [1],
  [1,2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2]
  [2,3]
  [3]
]
```

The order conjectured above is confirmed by the return value of our solution when `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:

```python
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

The process becomes even clearer if we add the print statement `print(subs)` after `subs.append(curr[:])` as well as the print statement `print('COMPLETED')` after `if num_idx == len(nums):`. Making these modifications and running the solution code again on the input `nums = [1,2,3]` results in the following being printed to standard output:

```
[[]]
[[], [1]]
[[], [1], [1, 2]]
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
COMPLETED
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3]]
COMPLETED
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2]]
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3]]
COMPLETED
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
COMPLETED
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

Note that the text `'COMPLETED'` is only ever printed after an element/subset has been added to `subs` that *ends* with `3`, which corresponds to the leaves of the tree shown earlier. 

To summarize, when generating permutations, we had a length requirement, where we needed to use *all* of the elements in the input; hence, we only considered leaf nodes as part of the actual returned answer. With subsets, however, there is no length requirement; thus, every node should be in the returned answer, including the root node, which is why the very first line of the `backtrack` function is to add a copy of `curr` to the returned answer `subs`.
