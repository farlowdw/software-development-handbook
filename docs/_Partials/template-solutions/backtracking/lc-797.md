```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def backtrack(curr_path, node):
            if node == len(graph) - 1:
                paths.append(curr_path[:])
                return
                
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                curr_path.append(neighbor)
                backtrack(curr_path, neighbor)
                curr_path.pop()
                
        paths = []
        backtrack([0], 0)
        
        return paths
```

This is a great backtracking problem because backtracking is not necessarily the obvious first strategy of attack. Even if we do think of backtracking, how exactly should we proceed? This becomes much clearer (again!) once we start to sketch out the tree of possibilities. What would the root of our tree be? It has to be node `0` since our goal is to find *all* paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`. This also suggests something about our base case: we should terminate path generation whenever node `n - 1` is reached. We don't have to worry about cycles or anything like that since we're told the graph is a DAG. Additionally, the graph is already provided as an adjacency list which makes traversing each node's neighbors quite easy.

So what's the strategy? Let's start with our root node (which needs to be part of every solution):

```
0
```

Now what? Each neighbor of node `0` needs to be considered (we're trying to get to node `n - 1` from node `0` in whatever way is possible, which means exploring all possible paths). Let's use the input of the second example on LeetCode for a concrete illustration: `graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]`. This graphs looks like the following:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/backtracking/f2.png').default} />
</div>

As stated above, from `0` we need to consider each of its neighbors:

```
     0
   / | \
  1  3  4
```

The tree above makes it clear `[0,4]` will be one possible path, but what are the other possible paths? It looks like leaf nodes will be the complete solutions that need to be added to our answer that we ultimately return. For each node that is *not* `4` (i.e., `n - 1 == 4` in this case), we need to consider each possible neighbor (this will not be endless because we're told the graph is a DAG). Considering the neighbors for each node means our tree of possibilities ultimately ends up looking as follows:

```
             0
       /     |     \
      1      3      4
    / | \    |
   2  3  4   4
   |  |
   3  4
   |
   4
```

Hence, the set of possible paths is as expected:

```python
[[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```
