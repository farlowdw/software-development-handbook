This problem invites us to dust off our knowledge of prefix sums &#8212; because that's really what we need to effectively answer this problem. We need to sort the input `nums`, create a prefix sum (either mutate the input directly, as above, or create a new array), and then conduct a binary search on the prefix sum where each time we try to find what would need to be the rightmost insertion point if we were to add `query` to the prefix sum array.

Why does this work. Suppose we had the prefix sum `[0, 1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9]`, and the query value we were given was `5`. Where would we need to insert `5` in the prefix sum above to maintain sorted order so that `5` was as far right as possible? It would need to be at index `i == 5` (right after the other two `5` values). This means the original numbers in `nums` responsible for the `[0, 1, 3, 5, 5]` part of the preifx sum can all be removed so that the sum is less than or equal to the query value `5`. That is why the solution above works.
