The problem description is one of the hardest things about this problem. But after fighting to understand it, our thinking will gradually start to resemble what's included in the hints and point us to binary search on the solution space as a good strategy:

```
Hint 1: If you can place balls such that the answer is x,
        then you can do it for y where y < x.

Hint 2: Similarly, if you cannot place balls such that 
        the answer is x then you can do it for y where y > x.

Hint 3: Binary search on the answer and greedily see if it is possible.
```

This problem is quite similar to <LC id='1231' type='long' ></LC> in many ways, but instead of trying to maximize the sweetness of our least sweet piece of chocolate amongst `k` friends, we are trying to maximize the magnetic force between the least magnetically attracted pair of balls. The idea is to binary search on possible answer values for the minimum magnetic force required and to maximize that value as much as possible.

Hence, our first task is to build a `possible` function to determine whether or not the task at hand is *possible* for some given magnetic force, and we greedily try to determine the possibility; that is, we place a ball whenever the magnetic force provided has been met or exceeded (this ensures the magnetic force provided is, indeed, minimum). All balls placed must have at least `min_mag_force` magnetic force between them. Our goal is to maximize that value.

The smallest possible magnetic force would be when we have `n` positions and `m == n` balls, where the positions are all spaced a single unit apart. That would give us a magnetic force of `1`, meaning we should set `left = 1`. The largest possible magnetic force would be the last position value minus the first position value (assuming the `position` array to be sorted at that point). Since the right endpoint needs to be included and we're always returning `left - 1`, we should set `right = (position[-1] - position[0]) + 1`.
