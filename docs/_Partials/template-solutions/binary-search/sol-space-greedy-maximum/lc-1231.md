This is such a fantastic problem, but it is quite difficult. As usual (for binary search problems on solution spaces anyway), constructing the `possible` function is where much of the difficulty lies. Our goal is to ensure we can actually come up with `k + 1` pieces of chocolate to distribute where each piece meets or exceeds the required `min_sweetness` threshold. If we can do that, then we're in business. But, of course, as the problem indicates, we want to *maximize* the minimum sweetness of our own piece of chocolate (since all other pieces distributed must have the same or more sweetness compared to our own).

Hence, we need to binary search on a range of possible minimum sweetness values. What would the smallest possible sweetness be? We're told from the constraint that every chunk of the chocolate has a sweetness of *at least* `1`; hence, we set `left = 1`. What about the largest possible sweetness? Note that `k == 0` is possible, which means there's a possibility where we need to share the chocolate bar with no one &#8212; in such a case, we would want to consume *all* of the sweetness, `sum(sweetness)`. But since we're binary searching a solution space for a *maximum* value, we need to set `right = sum(sweetness) + 1` as opposed to `right = sum(sweetness)`. Why? Because we might miss the maximum value in an off-by-one error otherwise; for example, consider the input `sweetness = [5,5], k = 0`. The while loop terminates once `left == right` and `right == sum(sweetness)`, but we return `left - 1`, which is equal to `10 - 1 == 9` instead of the obviously correct answer of `10`.
