                        adjacent_cell_val = heights[next_row][next_col]
                        if abs(adjacent_cell_val - cell_val) <= route_max_abs_diff:
                            seen.add((next_row, next_col))
                            if dfs(next_row, next_col):
                                return True
                            
                return False
            
            return dfs(0, 0)
        
        m = len(heights)
        n = len(heights[0])
        dirs = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
        
        left = 0
        right = max([element for row in heights for element in row]) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if possible(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
                
        return left
```

This is a great problem for a variety of reasons. It can be somewhat tricky at first though. The idea is that if we can find a path from the top left to the bottom right using a certain amount of `effort`, then we can certainly find a path that works for any greater amount of effort (i.e., `effort + 1`, `effort + 2`, etc.). But can we find a valid path using less effort? That's the real question.

If we let our solution space be the amount of effort required for a valid path, then we can binary search from the minimum possible amount of effort to the maximum possible amount of effort, inclusive. The goal is to find the effort amount for a valid path where any effort less than that would *not* result in a valid path.

What are the min/max effort bounds? The minimum possible effort is `0` because all of the numbers in the path could be the same. What about the maximum possible effort? That would be the max amount in the matrix minus the smallest amount:

```python
max([element for row in heights for element in row]) - 1
```

We could also observe the constraint `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6`, which means either of the following options would be valid for the problem at hand:

```python
# option 1
left = 0
right = max([element for row in heights for element in row]) - 1

# option 2
left = 0
right = 10 ** 6 - 1
```

The first option is obviously more costly in some respects, but the second option could result in a maximum boundary that is *much* larger than what we need. Since binary search is so fast, the second option is really not an issue though.

Finally, it should be noted that a stack-based DFS is also quite effective here to avoid the space overhead required by the call stack to deal with recursion:

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumEffortPath(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n
        
        def possible(route_max_abs_diff):
            seen = {(0,0)}
            def dfs(start_row, start_col):
                stack = [(start_row, start_col)]
                while stack:
                    row, col = stack.pop()
                    if row == m - 1 and col == n - 1:
                        return True
                    
                    for dr, dc in dirs:
                        next_row, next_col = row + dr, col + dc
                        if valid(next_row, next_col) and (next_row, next_col) not in seen:
                            cell_val = heights[row][col]
                            next_cell_val = heights[next_row][next_col]
                            if abs(next_cell_val - cell_val) <= route_max_abs_diff:
                                seen.add((next_row, next_col))
                                stack.append((next_row, next_col))
                            
                return False
            
            return dfs(0, 0)
        
        m = len(heights)
        n = len(heights[0])
        dirs = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
        
        left = 0
        right = max([element for row in heights for element in row]) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if possible(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
                
        return left
```
