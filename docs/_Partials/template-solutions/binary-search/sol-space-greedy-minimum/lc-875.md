```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        def possible(speed):
            hours_spent = 0
            for banana in piles:
                hours_spent += -(banana // -speed)
                if hours_spent > h:
                    return False
            return True
        
        left = 1
        right = max(piles)
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if possible(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
                
        return left
```

The idea is for Koko to go as slowly as possible while still being able to eat all bananas within `h` hours. Our goal is to find the speed at which Koko can eat all bananas but as soon as we decrease the speed it becomes impossible (that will give us the minimized speed for which eating all bananas is possible).

Hence, we can binary search on the solution space where the solution space is comprised of speeds in the range `[min_possible_speed, max_possible_speed]`, inclusive. What would make sense as a minimum possible speed? The speed needs to be an integer and it clearly can't be `0`; hence, the minimum possible speed is `0` so we set `left = 0`. What about the maximum possible speed? Each pile can be consumed within a single hour if the speed is the size of the pile with the greatest number of bananas; hence, the maximum possible speed we should account for is `max(piles)` so we set `right = max(piles)`.

All that is left to do now is to greedily search for the leftmost value in the solution space that satisfies the `possible` constraint.
