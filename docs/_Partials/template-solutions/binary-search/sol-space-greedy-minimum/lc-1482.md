```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, bloomDay: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
        def possible(days):
            bouquets_formed = flower_count = 0
            
            for flower in bloomDay:
                if flower <= days:
                    flower_count += 1
                else:
                    flower_count = 0
                    
                if flower_count == k:
                    bouquets_formed += 1
                    flower_count = 0
                    if bouquets_formed == m:
                        return True

            return False

        # not enough flowers for required number of bouquets        
        if len(bloomDay) < (m * k):
            return -1
        
        left = min(bloomDay)
        right = max(bloomDay)
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if possible(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
                
        return left
```

As usual, the primary difficulty in this problem is identifying it as having a nice binary search solution. The idea is to binary search on the solution space where the solution space is identified as being binary searchable as follows: if I can form `m` bouquets in `d` days, then I can definitely form `m` bouquets in `> d` days. We want to find the minimum number for `d` such that trying to form `m` bouquets in any fewer days is impossible. We can binary search for that number of days, as shown above.
