This problem is quite similar to <LC id='875' type='long' ></LC>. Our solution space is a range of possible divisors, and our goal is to minimize the divisor so that the running sum obtained by dividing each number in `nums` by `divisor` (and perforing the subsequent rounding up to the nearest integer) never exceeds `threshold`. 

If we can achieve this task for `divisor`, then we can definitely achieve the same task by *increasing* the value of `divisor` (e.g., `divisor + 1`). Our goal, then, is to find a `divisor` such that the task is possible but as soon as we *decrease* the value of divisor the task becomes impossible.

What would the minimum divisor be for our solution space? We're told it must be a positive integer; hence, we set `left = 1`. What about the maximum divisor? Since each division result gets rounded up to the nearest integer, the smallest the running sum could be would occur if we chose the divisor to be the maximum value in `nums`. Then no division would result in a value greater than `1`, and since we're told `nums.length <= threshold <= 10^6`, we let `right = max(nums)`.
