For any potion to actually be successful, it must be greater than or equal to `success / spell` for any given spell. Since we process `potions` for each spell in `spells`, this suggests we should pre-process `potions` by sorting. Then we can conduct a binary search (where the target is equal to `success / spell` for a given spell) to determine the where the insertion point would need to be in order for a new potion to be successful. We want everything *to the right* of that point. Hence, if `len(potions)` is the length of the potions array and we determine that the leftmost insertion point should occur at `i`, then we want everything from `[i, len(potions) - 1]`; that is, `(len(potions) - 1) - i + 1 == len(potions) - i`, where the first `+ 1` reflects inclusivity of `i`. An example will make this clear.

Let's say we sort `potions` and have `potions = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and `success = 7`. We have a spell with a strength of `3`. To form a successful pair, we need a potion with a strength of at least `7 / 3 = 2.3333`. If we do a binary search for this value on `potions`, we will find an insertion index of `2`. Every potion on this index and to the right can form a successful pair. There are `3` indices in total (the potions with strength `3`, `4`, `5`). In general, if there are `m` potions, the final index is `m - 1`. If the insertion index is `i`, then the range `[i, m - 1]` has a size of `(m - 1) - i + 1 = m - i`.
