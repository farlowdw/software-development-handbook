```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if target < nums[mid]:    # target in left half, move right boundary
                right = mid - 1
            elif target > nums[mid]:  # target in right half, move left boundary
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid            # target at current mid position, return
        
        return -1
```

The code above is *the* template for a basic binary search. We're guaranteed that the numbers in `nums` are unique, which means `target`, if it exists, will be found and the first index at which it occurs (and only index) will be returned.
