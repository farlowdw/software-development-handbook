```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        def binary_search(left, right, target):
            while left <= right:
                b = left + (right - left) // 2
                if target < b * b:
                    right = b - 1
                elif target > b * b:
                    left = b + 1
                else:
                    return True
            return False
        
        a = 0
        while a * a <= c:
            b_squared = c - a * a
            if binary_search(0, b_squared, b_squared):
                return True
            a += 1
        
        return False

Binary search can crop up in all sorts of unexpected places. This is one of them. The idea is that we iteratively search the space `[0, c - a^2]` for a value of `b` such that `b^2 == c - a^2` that way `a^2 + b^2 == c`, as desired. The funkier part of the binary search solution is what the usual `mid` denotes in the binary search itself, namely the `b`-value we're looking for such that `b^2 == target`, where `target == c - a^2`. Hence, when we make adjustments to the left or right endpoints, we're actually comparing the `target` value against `b * b` where `b` takes the role of the normal `mid` value. If it's ever the case that the `target` is neither less than `b * b` nor greater than `b * b`, then we've found an integer `b`-value that satisfies the equation (and we've done so using binary search!).
