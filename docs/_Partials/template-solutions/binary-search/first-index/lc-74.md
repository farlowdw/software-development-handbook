class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        
        left = 0
        right = m * n - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            val = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]
            if target < val:
                right = mid - 1
            elif target > val:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return True
            
        return False
```

This problem is very similar to the following classic binary search problem: <LC id='704' type='long' ></LC>. The main difference is that in this problem we basically need to view the 2D array `matrix` as virtually flattened into a 1D array with index values `idx` bounded by `0 <= idx <= m * n - 1`. The key part of the solution above is, of course, the following line: `val = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]`. This lets us seamlessly find a cell value in the virtually flattened matrix by converting a given index value to the appropriate row and column in the original input matrix. We could make this more explicit by abstracting away the logic in the line above into its own function:

```python
def index_to_cell_val(idx):
    row = idx // n
    col = idx % n
    return matrix[row][col]
```

The idea is that we can binary search on the virtually flattened 1D array.
