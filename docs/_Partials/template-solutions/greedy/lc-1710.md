```python
class Solution:
    def maximumUnits(self, boxTypes: List[List[int]], truckSize: int) -> int:
        boxTypes.sort(key=lambda box_type: box_type[1], reverse=True)
        units_loaded = 0
        for boxes, units in boxTypes:
            boxes = min(truckSize, boxes)
            units_loaded += (boxes * units)
            truckSize -= boxes
            if truckSize == 0:
                return units_loaded
            
        return units_loaded
```

As usual, it's easy to over-complicate things on this one. The important greedy insight is that we're given the *units per box* for each box type and we make no distinction between type of unit or type of box; hence, it makes sense to add as many units as we can per box before exhausting the number of boxes we're allowed to load on to the truck.
