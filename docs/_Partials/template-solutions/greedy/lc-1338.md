```python
class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        freqs = defaultdict(int)
        for num in arr:
            freqs[num] += 1
        
        max_heap = []
        for _, freq in freqs.items():
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -freq)
        
        arr_size = len(arr)
        target = arr_size / 2
        set_size = 0
        while arr_size > target:
            arr_size += heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            set_size += 1
            
        return set_size
```

The idea in the solution above is to greedily remove the element that occurs most frequently at each step. This ensures we reduce the original array size by half as efficiently as possible.
