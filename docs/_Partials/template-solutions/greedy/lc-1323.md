```python
class Solution:
    def maximum69Number(self, num: int) -> int:
        pos = 0
        first_six_pos = -1
        ref_num = num
        
        while num > 0:
            if num % 10 == 6:
                first_six_pos = pos
            num //= 10
            pos += 1
            
        return ref_num if first_six_pos == -1 else ref_num + 3 * (10 ** first_six_pos)
```

The key greedy insight: the *first* `6` we encounter in the number (if there is one) should be changed to a `9`. That's it. And it seems fairly clear. The real challenge is how to get at the final number reported in an efficient manner.

```python
class Solution:
    def maximum69Number(self, num: int) -> int:
        def get_digits(number):
            digits = []
            while number > 0:
                rem = number % 10
                digits.append(rem)
                number //= 10
            return digits
        
        digits = get_digits(num)
        ans = 9
        NINE_FOUND = True if digits[-1] == 6 else False
        for i in range(len(digits) - 2, -1, -1):
            digit = digits[i]
            if digit == 6:
                if not NINE_FOUND:
                    ans = ans * 10 + 9
                    NINE_FOUND = True
                else:
                    ans = ans * 10 + 6
            else:
                ans = ans * 10 + 9
                
        return ans
```

Try not to do something silly here. It's hard not to though. The key implementation insight is recognizing that, for example, the difference between `9` and `6` is `3`. The difference between `96` and `99` and is `3`. The difference between `69` and `99` is `30`. The difference between `699` and `999` is `300`. And so on. In general, if no `6` exists, then we should return the original number as no improvement can be made in terms of increasing the number's magnitude.

If, however, a `6` does exist, then we should find the first occurrence as well as its position from the end (with the far right position being `0`). Changing something like `969699` to `999699` can then be seen as the following: `969699 + 3 * (10 ** 4) == 999699`. This is mostly just a clever manipulation that is highly problem-specific. But it is somewhat interesting nonetheless.
