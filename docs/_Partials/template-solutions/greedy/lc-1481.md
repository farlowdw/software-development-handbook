```python
class Solution:
    def findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        freqs = defaultdict(int)
        for num in arr:
            freqs[num] += 1
            
        freqs = sorted(freqs.values(), reverse=True)
        while k > 0:
            freq = freqs[-1]
            k -= freq
            if k < 0:
                return len(freqs)
            freqs.pop()
        
        return len(freqs)
```

The core idea in this problem is to first count the frequency with which each number occurs and then to remove numbers one at a time from least frequent to most frequent. A variety of ways exist for doing this (e.g., reverse sorting as above and then popping, using a min heap, etc.). But the main greedy strategy is to remove the least frequently occurring numbers first.
