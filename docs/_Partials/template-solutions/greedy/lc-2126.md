```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidsDestroyed(self, mass: int, asteroids: List[int]) -> bool:
        asteroids.sort()
        for asteroid in asteroids:
            if asteroid > mass:
                return False
            mass += asteroid
        return True
```

If our planet is not at least as heavy as the smallest asteroid, then it's clearly impossible to destroy all asteroids. The strategy is to destroy and consume the smallest asteroids first, thus ensuring we can destroy as many asteroids as possible. The solution to this problem naturally lends itself to a greedy approach.
