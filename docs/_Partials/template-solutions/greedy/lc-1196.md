```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfApples(self, weight: List[int]) -> int:
        weight.sort()
        weight_used = 0
        apples = 0
        for apple_weight in weight:
            weight_used += apple_weight
            if weight_used > 5000:
                return apples
            apples += 1
        return apples
```

This is about as straightforward a greedy algorithm problem as there can be. To maximize the number of apples placed in the basket, we always add the lightest apple at each step.
