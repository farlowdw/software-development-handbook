```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        boats = 0
        people.sort()
        lightest = 0
        heaviest = len(people) - 1
        while lightest <= heaviest:
            if people[heaviest] + people[lightest] <= limit:
                lightest += 1
            heaviest -= 1
            boats += 1
            
        return boats
```

The [solution editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/solution/) highlights the key ideas best:

> If the heaviest person can share a boat with the lightest person, then do so. Otherwise, the heaviest person can't pair with anyone, so they get their own boat.
>
> The reason this works is because if the lightest person can pair with anyone, they might as well pair with the heaviest person.
