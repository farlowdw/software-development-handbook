```python
class Solution:
    def partitionArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        ans = 1
        curr_min = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] - curr_min > k:
                ans += 1
                curr_min = nums[i] 
        return ans
```

Intuitively, it makes sense that we would like to cover as many numbers as possible for each subsequence that we could create. We could sort the input and then bunch as many items together as possible whose min-max difference is at most `k`. The solution above does just that.
