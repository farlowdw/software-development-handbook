```python
class Solution:
    def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: int, w: int, profits: List[int], capital: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(profits)
        projects = []
        for i in range(n):
            projects.append((capital[i], profits[i]))
        projects.sort()
        
        max_heap = []
        i = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            # push projects to the max heap (based on profit) that we have the capital to start
            while i < n and w >= projects[i][0]:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, -projects[i][1])
                i += 1
            
            # not enough capital to complete anymore projects
            if not max_heap:
                return w
            
            w -= heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            
        return w
```

This problem is rather confusing at first because *the capital used to start a project is not deducted from the running capital total*; hence, all we really need to do is maximize the profit we can obtain at each step. Sort the `capital` input array in ascending order and use a max heap to keep track of projects and the profits that can be obtained. The strategy is basically to keep pushing profit-based items (i.e., projects) to the max heap so long as we have the capital to start such projects. As soon as we don't have enough capital to cover the next project, we simply pop the item from the heap that gives us the maximal profit that we *can* cover &#8212; as noted above, we also *do not deduct the capital just used to obtain profit*. This means we're always starting projects for which we can gain the most profit.
