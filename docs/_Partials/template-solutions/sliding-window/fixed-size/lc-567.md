**Time:** $O(n)$. The `left` and `right` pointers can iterate a total number of `n` times where `n = len(s2)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The space is technically $O(1)$ since the character set only has $26$ characters, meaning $O(26) = O(1)$.

Why is a fixed-width sliding window appropriate here? Because no matter how we permute the characters of `s1`, the "block" of permuted characters must appear as a "block" (i.e., substring) in `s2`; hence, if we let `k = len(s1)`, then the goal is to efficiently consider all `k`-length windows of `s2` (i.e., all substrings of length `k` in `s2`).

How can we do this *efficiently*? The idea is to maintain a sort of ledger that maps each letter to the number of *excess occurrences* of that letter in the window relative to `s1`. Let `surplus` serve the role of this ledger (implemented as a hash map). For example, 

- if `surplus['a'] = 3`, then this means that the current window has `3` more `a`'s than the number of `a`'s in `s1`. Conversely, 
- if `surplus['a'] = -3`, then this means that the current window has `3` fewer `a`'s than the number of `a`'s in `s1`. Finally,
- if `surplus['a'] = 0`, then this means that the current window has the same number of `a`'s as the number of `a`'s in `s1`.

The window (i.e., substring of `s2`) is a permutation of `s1` when *all* surplus values are `0`.

To avoid summing *all* surplus values after each iteration, we instead keep track of the sum of the *absolute value* of all surplus values in the `mismatches` variable (the absolute value is used because we want to avoid situations where a positive surplus cancels out a negative surplus) &#8212; if that sum is `0`, then we have found a permutation.

Each time we slide the window, we need to update both window data structures: the `surplus` ledger and the `mismatches` sum.
