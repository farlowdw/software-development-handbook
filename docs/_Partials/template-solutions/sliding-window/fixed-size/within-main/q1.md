```python
def largest_sum_length_k(nums, k):
    curr = 0
    ans = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i >= k:
            ans = max(curr, ans)
            curr -= nums[i - k]
        curr += nums[i]
    
    ans = max(ans, curr)
        
    return ans
```

The flow here is a bit unnatural compared to first building the `k`-size window, then initializing the answer variable, and then proceeding to slide the window. The solution above makes it clear it's possible to build out a solution all within the main loop, but sometimes it likely will not be preferable.
