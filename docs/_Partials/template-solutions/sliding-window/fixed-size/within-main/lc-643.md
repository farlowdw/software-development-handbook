```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        curr = 0
        ans = float('-inf')
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i >= k:
                ans = max(ans, curr / k)
                curr -= nums[i - k]
            curr += nums[i]
            
        ans = max(ans, curr / k)
        return ans
```

The solution above is *not* the recommended approach. It's clear the flow above is rather unnatural. Oftentimes it is more natural to first build the window *outside* the main loop and then continue. But it is *possible* to do it all in one go, as shown above (though not recommended).
