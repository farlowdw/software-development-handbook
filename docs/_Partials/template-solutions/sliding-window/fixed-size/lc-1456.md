```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' }
        curr = 0
        for right in range(1, k + 1):
            if s[right - 1] in vowels:
                curr += 1
                
        ans = curr
        for right in range(k + 1, len(s) + 1):
            if s[right - 1] in vowels:
                curr += 1
                
            if s[right - 1 - k] in vowels:
                curr -= 1
                
            ans = max(ans, curr)
            
        return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each character in `s` is processed in $O(1)$ time.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The set with the vowels is the only additionally allocated space, and it does not increase with an increased size in the input.
