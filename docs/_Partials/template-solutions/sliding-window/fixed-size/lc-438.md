**Time:** $O(n)$. This is almost the same as the following problem: <LC id='567' type='long' ></LC>, but instead we *aggregate* permutations by collecting their starting indices instead of immediately returning `true` once one is found.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The `anagrams` output is not included in the overal space cost since it is the expected return value.
