**Time:** $O(n)$. Each element of `nums` is processed and is done so in $O(1)$ time.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Additional memory is not consumed as the input grows in size.

<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

Since we want to increase the count when a `1` is encountered and enters the window and decrease the count when a `1` leaves the window, we can clean up the code above to be a bit more concise:

```python
def maxOnes(nums, k):
    curr = 0
    for right in range(1, k + 1):
        curr += nums[right - 1]
        
    ans = curr
    for right in range(k + 1, len(nums) + 1):
        curr += nums[right - 1]
        curr -= nums[right - 1 - k]
        ans = max(ans, curr)
    
    return ans
```

But this is mostly a consequence of the fact that we're increasing the count when we encounter a `1`, which is exactly what we need to add (or remove) from the cumulative sum being maintained. If, instead, we wanted to keep track of the maximum number of `8`'s in a subarray of length `5`, then the cleanup done above would not work, and we would need to revert back to something like the original solution at the beginning.

Ultimately, the window property or constraint for this problem is to "have length `k`", and what we're trying to optimize is the number of `1`'s in a `k`-length subarray. We start with a window of length `k`, where `left = 0` is implied and `right = k`. This corresponds to building the `k`-length window within the following block:

```python
for right in range(1, k + 1):
    # ...
```

We process the rest of the fixed-length subarrays/windows in the following block (we stop when `right == len(nums)`):

```python
for right in range(k + 1, len(nums) + 1):
    # ...
```

Worth noting is how we don't actually need a `left` pointer: each time `right` is incremented, we implicitly increment `left`; that is, incrementing `right` corresponds to adding `nums[right - 1]` to our window, and implicitly incrementing `left` corresponds to removing `nums[right - 1 - k]` from our window. Why? 

Once the initial window is built, we see that our subarray or window spans the interval `[0, k)`, where `left == 0` and `right == k`. In general, for a `k`-length window, if we have `left = x`, then we will have `right = x + k`, where the length of the window is given by `right - left == (x + k) - x == k` and can be represented in interval notation as `[x, x + k)`. 

What happens if our window shifts one unit to the right? We will still have `[x, x + k)`, where `right = x + k`, but the previous window is now represented differently:

$$
[
  \overbrace{{\color{red}{\texttt{nums[x - 1]}}}}^{\substack{\text{first value}\\\text{of old window}}}, 
  \overbrace{\texttt{nums[x]}}^{\substack{\text{first value}\\\text{of new window}}},\quad
  \ldots\quad,
  \overbrace{\texttt{nums[x + k - 2]}}^{\substack{\text{last value}\\\text{of old window}}}, 
  \overbrace{{\color{green}{\texttt{nums[x + k - 1]}}}}^{\substack{\text{last value}\\\text{of new window}}},
  \overbrace{\texttt{nums[x + k]}}^{\texttt{right = x + k}}
)
$$

To maintain our window, we need to remove the value highlighted in red above, and we need to add the value highlighted in green. Since `right = x + k`, the value we need to add to our window is

```
nums[x + k - 1] == nums[(x + k) - 1] = nums[right - 1]
```

and the value we need to remove from our window is

```
nums[x - 1] = nums[(right - k) - 1] = nums[right - 1 - k]
```

where above we make use of the fact that `x = right - k` follows from the fact that `right = x + k`.

Ultimately, the sequence of sliding windows looks like the image below, where `nums = [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1]` and `k = 5`:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='700px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/sliding-window/f2.png').default} />
</div>

Each row shows a `k`-length window in red (`k = 5` in this example). We stop when `right = len(arr)`.
