```python
def largest_sum_length_k(nums, k):
    curr = 0
    for i in range(k):
        curr += nums[i]
        
    ans = curr
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        curr += nums[i]
        curr -= nums[i - k]
        ans = max(ans, curr)
        
    return ans
```

The idea here is that we first build the sum of the first window of size `k`. Then we continue onward by adding and removing elements from the `k`-size window while keeping track of the current window sum and comparing that to the maximum, the final of which we return as the ultimate answer.
