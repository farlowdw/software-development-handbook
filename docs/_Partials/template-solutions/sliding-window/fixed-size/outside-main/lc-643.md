```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        curr = ans = 0
        for i in range(k):
            curr += nums[i]
            
        ans = curr / k
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            curr += nums[i]
            curr -= nums[i - k]
            ans = max(ans, curr / k)
            
        return ans
```

The solution above is much more natural than the alternative of building the window *within* the main loop.

**Time:** $O(n)$. The entire `nums` array is processed, where `n == len(nums)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. No additional space is consumed in proportion to the input size.
