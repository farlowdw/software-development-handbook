```python
def find_best_subarray(nums, k):
    curr = 0
    for right in range(1, k + 1):
        curr += nums[right - 1]
        
    ans = curr
    for right in range(k + 1, len(nums) + 1):
        curr += nums[right - 1]
        curr -= nums[right - 1 - k]
        ans = max(ans, curr)
        
    return ans
```

The idea here is that we first build the sum of the first window of size `k`. Then we continue onward by adding and removing elements from the `k`-size window while keeping track of the current window sum and comparing that to the maximum, the final of which we return as the ultimate answer.

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `i` pointer will move a total of $n$ units where `n == len(nums)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. No additional space is consumed in proportion to the input.
