```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = curr = ans = 0
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                curr += 1
            while left <= right and curr > k:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    curr -= 1
                left += 1
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
            
        return ans
```

The hardest part about this problem is arguably the clever manipulaton of the `left` pointer. Ensuring `curr` is only decremented when `left` is currently pointing at `0` and *then* incrementing the `left` counter is the way to go. Doing this out of order (e.g., trying to increment `left` before decrementing `curr`) can lead to some headaches.
