```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = ans = 0
        curr = 1
        
        for right in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
            curr *= nums[right - 1]
            while left < right and curr >= k:
                curr //= nums[left]
                left += 1
            ans += (right - left)
            
        return ans
```

For a valid sliding window `[left, right)` that satisfies the condition and constraints, note that adding `right - left` to `ans` effectively adds the total number of subarrays in the range `[left, right)` that **end** at `right - 1`, inclusive.

This is a nifty trick we can use when the subarrays in question exhibit some sort of "monotonic" property; in this case, the product for positive integers uniformly *increases* as we add more positive integers to multiply (i.e., as the window becomes larger).

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `right` pointer moves a maximum of $n$ units, where `n = len(nums)`, and `left` moves a maximum of $n$ units as well, meaning our overall time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The space used does not grow in proportion to the size of the input. It is constant.
