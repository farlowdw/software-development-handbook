```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        left = curr_max = ans = 0
        freqs = defaultdict(int)
        
        for right in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            freqs[s[right - 1]] += 1
            curr_max = max(curr_max, freqs[s[right - 1]])
            while left < right and right - left - curr_max > k:
                freqs[s[left]] -= 1
                curr_max = max(curr_max, freqs[s[left]])
                left += 1
            ans = max(ans, right - left)
            
        return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `left` and `right` pointers make a maximum of `n` iterations each, where `n = len(s)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The frequency of each character is tracked which means the size is $O(26) = O(1)$.

The key realization is to precisely define the window property/constraint that must be maintained: *the window contains at most `k` characters which are not the most frequently occurring one*. Hence, we keep a frequency count, `freqs`, of each character in the window, and we maintain a counter, `curr_max`, that maintains the current maximum frequency for any character in the window. 

The idea is that the window, which may be represented by the interval `[left, right)`, has length `right - left`, where the character that occurs most frequently occurs a total of `curr_max` times. Consequently, we can change up to `k` of the remaining `(right - left) - curr_max` characters to be the character that occurs most frequently so that the entire window is made up of the same character. But once `(right - left) - curr_max` exceeds `k`, then our window becomes invalid, and we must shrink it in order to make every character in the window the same character.
