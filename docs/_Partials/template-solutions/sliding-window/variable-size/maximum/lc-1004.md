    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = curr = ans = 0
        for right in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
            if nums[right - 1] == 0:
                curr += 1
                
            while left < right and curr > k:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    curr -= 1
                left += 1
                
            ans = max(ans, right - left)

```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each element in `nums` is processed in $O(1)$ time.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Additional memory is not consumed in proportion to an increase in the input size.

<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

Since we're interested in finding the *longest* subarray with some property, our goal is to *maximize* the window size as much as possible until we're forced to shrink it. Specifically, if we can grow the window by adding `nums[right - 1]` to it without making the window invalid, then we do so; otherwise, we shrink the window by removing `nums[left]` from it.

Maximum windows are like restarting windows in that they are intended for problems where we are trying to find a subarray/window that is as large as possible. The main difference is that, for maximum windows, we don't throw away the entire window once it becomes invalid; instead, we increment the `left` pointer one by one until we can expand the window again (i.e., until the window is either empty or becomes valid again).

For this problem specifically, it can help to rephrase the problem from

> Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.

to 

> Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest subarray containing at most `k` `0`'s.

The sequence of sliding windows then looks like the image below:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='550px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/sliding-window/f3.png').default} />
</div>

Each row shows one window in red, where we start with an empty window (i.e., `left = 0 ` and `right = 0`). And we stop when `right == len(nums)`. The final answer is `9`.
