```python
def find_length(nums, k):
    left = curr = ans = 0
    
    for right in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
        curr += nums[right - 1]
        while left < right and curr > k:
            curr -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        ans = max(ans, right - left)
        
    return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. The for loop can iterate a maximum number of $n$ times, where `n = len(nums)`. The same is true for the while loop. Basically `right` is progressed $n$ units while `left` is progressed a maximum of $n$ units, meaning our overall time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The space required does not scale with the input here, which means the space required is constant.
