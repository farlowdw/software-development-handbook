```python
class Solution:
    def longestMonotonicSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        inc_window = 1
        dec_window = 1
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                inc_window += 1
                dec_window = 1
            elif nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
                dec_window += 1
                inc_window = 1
            else:
                inc_window = 1
                dec_window = 1
            
            ans = max(ans, inc_window, dec_window)
        
        return ans
```

This is a slightly unconventional variable-width sliding window problem due to how the sizes of the windows are being changed, namely incrementally being grown by `1` or being reset to `1` for each iteration. The solution above is a very nice single-pass solution.

The following solution looks like more like the standard variable-width sliding window approach even though it's not nearly as nice (or efficient since two passes are being made):

```python
class Solution:
    def longestMonotonicSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def longest_monotonic_sub(arr, comparison):
            left = 0
            ans = 1
            for right in range(1, len(arr)):
                prev = arr[right - 1]
                curr = arr[right]
                if left < right and (prev >= curr if comparison == 'inc' else prev <= curr):
                    left = right
                ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)    
            return ans
        return max(longest_monotonic_sub(nums, 'inc'), longest_monotonic_sub(nums, 'dec'))
```
