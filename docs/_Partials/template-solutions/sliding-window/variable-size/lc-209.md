```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        MAX_NUMS_LENGTH = 10 ** 5 + 1
        left = 0
        curr = 0
        ans = MAX_NUMS_LENGTH
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            curr += nums[right]
            while left <= right and curr >= target:
                ans = min(ans, right - left + 1)
                curr -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            
        return 0 if ans == MAX_NUMS_LENGTH else ans
```

Sometimes the standard template needs to be modified slightly. This problem is clearly asking to be solved via sliding window, but the most natural way of solving the problem does not conform completely to the template. That's okay. Specifically, we *want* the condition of the window to be met before we remove any elements and/or update the answer.
