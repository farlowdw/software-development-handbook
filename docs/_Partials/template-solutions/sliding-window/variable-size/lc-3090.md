```python
class Solution:
    def maximumLengthSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        left = ans = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            curr_char = s[right]
            lookup[curr_char] += 1
            while left <= right and lookup[curr_char] > 2:
                prev_char = s[left]
                lookup[prev_char] -= 1
                left += 1
                
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
            
        return ans
```

The idea is effectively to use a hash map to track the frequency of characters as we encounter them &#8212; as soon as a character occurs more than `2` times (the right boundary), move the left boundry until a valid window is attained (subtracting out the character frequencies from the hash map along the way).

Note how easy it is to extend this solution to a number `k >= 2`:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumLengthSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        left = ans = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            curr_char = s[right]
            lookup[curr_char] += 1
            # highlight-next-line
            while left <= right and lookup[curr_char] > k:
                prev_char = s[left]
                lookup[prev_char] -= 1
                left += 1
                
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
            
        return ans
```

That's pretty much the only change that's needed. A sliding window in conjunction with a hash map can be quite powerful.
