```python
def find_length(nums, k):
    # early return (minor optimization)
    if k <= 0:
        return -1
    
    left = curr = ans = 0
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        curr += nums[right]
        while left <= right and curr > k:
            curr -= nums[left]
            left += 1
            
        ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
        
    return ans
```

Note the important above of the non-strict inequality `left <= right`: if, say `k = 8`, and `nums = [9,9,9]`, then the final answer should be `0`, but if we use `left < right`, then the (incorrect) reported answer would be `1`.

**Time:** $O(n)$. The for loop can iterate a maximum number of $n$ times, where `n = len(nums)`. The same is true for the while loop. Basically `right` is progressed $n$ units while `left` is progressed a maximum of $n$ units, meaning our overall time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The space required does not scale with the input here, which means the space required is constant.
