```python
def find_length(s):
    left = ans = curr = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0':
            curr += 1
            
        while left <= right and curr > 1:
            if s[left] == '0':
                curr -= 1
            left += 1
            
        ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
    
    return ans
```

Above, `curr` denotes the current number of zeroes in the window.

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `right` pointer moves $n$ units, where `n = len(s)`, and `left` moves a maximum total of $n$ units, meaning the overall time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The space used is constant proportional to the input.
