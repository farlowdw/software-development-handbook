**Problem:** Given an array of `0`'s and `1`'s and a number `k`, find the shortest subarray that contains `k` `1`'s.

---

```python
def shortest_subarray_with_k_1s(nums, k):
    left = curr = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    
    for right in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
        if nums[right - 1] == 1:
            curr += 1
            
        while left < right and curr == k:
            ans = min(ans, right - left)
            if nums[left] == 1:
                curr -= 1
            left += 1
            
    return ans if ans != float('inf') else 0
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `left` and `right` pointers can iterate a total number of `n` times where `len(nums) == n`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. No additional memory is consumed as the input size grows.

Suppose we were given the following as our input:

```
nums = [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1], k = 4
```

The sequence of sliding windows would look like the image below.

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='550px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/sliding-window/f4.png').default} />
</div>

Each row shows one window in red. We start with an empty window, and we stop when the window is invalid and we cannot grow it anymore. The final answer is `5`.
