```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curr = ans = nums[0]
        for right in range(2, len(nums) + 1):
            if curr < 0:
                curr = nums[right - 1]
            else:
                curr += nums[right - 1]
            ans = max(ans, curr)
        return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Every element of `nums` is processed, and it takes $O(1)$ time to process each element.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The amount of memory consumed does not increase in proportion to the input size.

<ChipDivider>Kadane's algorithm</ChipDivider> 

The code above is actually a reformulation of [Kadane's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem#Kadane's_algorithm), which uses some [clever observations](#kadane) to process the entire array in linear time. The usual formulation of Kadane's algorithm is the following:

```python
def max_subarray(numbers):
    """Find the largest sum of any contiguous subarray."""
    best_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for x in numbers:
        #highlight-success-next-line
        current_sum = max(x, current_sum + x)
        best_sum = max(best_sum, current_sum)
    return best_sum
```

The highlighted line is the key to understanding why Kadane's algorithm works. If `current_sum` is negative (i.e., `curr` in our solution above), where `current_sum` denotes the current sum of the subarray/window we're currently considering/maintaining, then what could possibly be gained by *extending* the window to effectively decrease our running sum (i.e., if `current_sum` is negative, then `x` must be greater than `current_sum + x`)? It would be better if we simply restarted our window to contain only the number `x`.

The logic outlined above is easier to see in the usual formulation of Kadane's algorithm, but it doesn't change the fact that this is essentially a "restarting window" with a very clever observation to make it work. It's also worth noting that `ans = max(ans, curr)` occurs *after* the `if`/`else` block because the single element window upon restarting the window may sometimes be optimal.
