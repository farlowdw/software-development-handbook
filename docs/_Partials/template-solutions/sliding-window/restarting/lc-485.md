**Time:** $O(n)$. Each element in `nums` is processed in $O(1)$ time.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The memory consumed does not increase in proportion to the size of the input.

The solution above is nice and neat, but it's worth discussing this problem more as a quintessential example of the "restarting window" template in action. The window property/constraint in this problem is to "contain only `1`'s", and the goal is to maximize the length of whatever subarrays we can find that satisfy this constraint.

Note that any window that contains a `0` is invalid; hence, encountering a `0` causes whatever window we're maintaining to restart. The sequence of sliding windows would look like the image below, where each row shows one window in red &#8212; a single vertical red line denotes an empty window where the two pointers are at the same index (i.e., `left == right`). We start with an empty window (i.e., `left = 0`, `right = 0`, `left == right`) and stop when `right == len(nums)`, resulting in a final answer of `3` for the example below:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='500px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/sliding-window/f1.png').default} />
</div>

This process can be explicitly coded in the following manner:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0                              # `right = 0` is implied (start with an empty window)
        ans = 0                               # variable to keep track of the longest valid window encountered
        for right in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
            if nums[right - 1] != 1:          # entire window invalidated (encountered element not 1)
                left = right                  # restart the window to be empty
            else:
                ans = max(ans, right - left)  # `right - left` gives the length of the current valid window
                
        return ans
```

Since the `left` pointer is only being used for length calculations and it always skips ahead to `right` when we reset the window, most solutions that use a restarting window approach will not explicitly use a `left` pointer but instead maintain a data structure for each window and then just reset it when needed, as above:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curr = ans = 0                          # curr denotes size of current valid window (ans the largest found)
        for right in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
            if nums[right - 1] != 1:
                curr = 0                        # restart size of current valid window to `0`
            else:
                curr += 1
                ans = max(ans, curr)
                
        return ans
```
