```python
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        curr_char = s[0]
        curr = power = 1
        for right in range(2, len(s) + 1):
            if s[right - 1] != curr_char:
                curr_char = s[right - 1]
                curr = 1
            else:
                curr += 1
                power = max(power, curr)
                
        return power
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. We process all elements in `nums` and it takes $O(1)$ time to process each element.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The memory consumed does not increase in proportion to the input size.

Note that this problem is an example of one where we always want the window to have a single element (the current character being considered).
