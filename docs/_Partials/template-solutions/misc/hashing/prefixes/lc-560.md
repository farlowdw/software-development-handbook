```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # prefix sum lookup
        lookup = defaultdict(int)   # `lookup[x] = y` means a subarray with sum `x` has occurred `y` times up to this point
        lookup[0] = 1               # empty sum of 0 has occurred 1 time with empty subarray
        curr = 0                    # cumulative running sum
        ans = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            curr += num             # updating running sum to include `num`
            ans += lookup[curr - k] # add number of subarrays previously encountered with sum of `curr - k` (because `curr - (curr - k) = k`)
            lookup[curr] += 1       # one more subarray has been found whose element sum is `curr`
     
        return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each number in `nums` is processed, where `n = len(nums)`.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The hash map can grow to a size of $n$ elements.
