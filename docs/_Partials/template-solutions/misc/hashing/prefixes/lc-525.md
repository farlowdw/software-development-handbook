```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        lookup = { 0: -1 }  # `lookup[x] = y` means the difference `x` was first seen at index `y`
                            # if a valid contiguous array starts at index `0` and ends at index `i`, its length is `i + 1` or `i - (-1)`
        diff = 0
        ans = 0
     
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            num = nums[i]
            if num == 1:
                diff += 1
            else:
                diff -= 1
                
            if diff in lookup:
                ans = max(ans, i - lookup[diff])
            else:
                lookup[diff] = i
                
        return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each number in `nums` is processed, where `n == len(nums)`.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The size of the hash map can grow in proportion to the numbers in `nums`.

The following illustrations summarizes the key idea behind the solution above:

$$
[\underbrace{\underbrace{1,1,1}_{\substack{\text{diff = 3}\\\text{index = 2}}},\underbrace{\overbrace{x,x,x,x,x,x}^{\substack{\text{0s and 1s added}\\\text{in the interim}}}}_{\text{must be balanced}}}_{\substack{\text{diff = 3}\\\text{index = 8}\\\text{length = 8 - 2 = 6}}},\ldots]
$$

The initialization of `lookup = {0: -1}` ensures we do not improperly compute the length of a subarray that may begin at the beginning of the input array; for example, if `nums = [0,1]`, then `curr = 0` and `i - lookup[curr] = 1 - (-1) = 2` yields a correct result whereas a different initialization condition (e.g., `lookup = {0: 0}`) would not.

Of course, if we really really want to go forward with an initialization like `lookup = {0: 0}`, then we can, but we just have to be careful with handling the case where the left boundary is included (not recommended):

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        #highlight-next-line
        lookup = { 0: 0 }
        diff = 0
        ans = 0
     
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            num = nums[i]
            if num == 1:
                diff += 1
            else:
                diff -= 1
                
            if diff in lookup:
                #highlight-next-line
                ans = max(ans, i - lookup[diff] if diff != 0 else i + 1)
            else:
                lookup[diff] = i
                
        return ans
```
