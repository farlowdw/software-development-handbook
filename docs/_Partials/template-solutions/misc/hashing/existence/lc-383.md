```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        if len(ransomNote) > len(magazine):
            return False
        
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        for letter in magazine:
            lookup[letter] += 1
            
        for letter in ransomNote:
            if lookup[letter] == 0:
                return False
            lookup[letter] -= 1
            
        return True
```

The idea is to chip away at `ransomNote` one character at a time. To do this efficiently, we convert the characters in `magazine` into a hash map for efficient frequency lookups. If the letter we are trying to chip away from the `ransomNote` does not exist in the magazine lookup, then we know a solution is not possible.

**Time:** $O(n)$. We process all characters in `ransomNote` and `magazine`, where `n == len(magazine)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. We're told all characters are lowercase English, but $O(k)$ might be more accurate if we're willing to accommodate more character sets.
