```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        if len(magazine) < len(ransomNote):
            return False
        
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        for char in magazine:
            lookup[char] += 1
            
        for char in ransomNote:
            if lookup[char] >= 1:
                lookup[char] -= 1
            else:
                return False
            
        return True
```

The idea is to chip away at `ransomNote` one character at a time. To do this efficiently, we can convert the characters in `magazine` into a hash map for efficient frequency lookups. If the letter we are trying to chip away from the `ransomNote` does not exist in the magazine lookup, then we know a solution is not possible.
