```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False
        
        w1_lookup = defaultdict(int)
        w2_lookup = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(len(word1)):
            w1_char = word1[i]
            w2_char = word2[i]
            w1_lookup[w1_char] += 1
            w2_lookup[w2_char] += 1
            
        char_match = w1_lookup.keys() == w2_lookup.keys()
        freqs_match = sorted(w1_lookup.values()) == sorted(w2_lookup.values())

```

If the words do not have the same length, then nothing can be done to make them equivalent. Since we are only allowed to change one letter into another and not *create* new letters, the set of unique letters in each word must be identical. Additionally, the list of frequencies needs to be the same to account for single-swaps or all-swaps.
