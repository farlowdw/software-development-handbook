```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_lookup = defaultdict(list)
        t_lookup = defaultdict(list)
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            char_s = s[i]
            char_t = t[i]
            s_lookup[char_s].append(i)
            t_lookup[char_t].append(i)

        return sorted(s_lookup.values()) == sorted(t_lookup.values())
```

The solution above is probably one of the more natural solutions even though it is not the most efficient. The idea is to keep track of the positional values for the different characters in each string &#8212; if the sorted lists are the same, then the strings must be isomorphic.

A more efficient way of crafting a solution is to come up with a nifty way of effectively "encoding" each string:

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def encode(s):
            lookup = {}
            encoding = []
            for char in s:
                if char not in lookup:
                    lookup[char] = len(lookup)
                encoding.append(lookup[char])
            return str(encoding)
    
        return encode(s) == encode(t)
```

The `encode` function "encodes" a string by mapping each *unique* character to a *unique* integer, based on the order in which the character first appears in the string. It effectively allows us to sidestep the need for direct character comparison, instead relying on the position-based pattern of appearances. 

For example, here's how the string `"hello"` would be encoded:

- For `h`, since it's new, `lookup[h] = 0`. The encoding list begins as `[0]`.
- For `e`, since it's new, `lookup[e] = 1`. The encoding list updates to `[0, 1]`.
- For the first `l`, since it's new, `lookup[l] = 2`. The encoding list updates to `[0, 1, 2]`.
- For the second `l`, it's already in `lookup` with `lookup[l] = 2`. The encoding list updates to `[0, 1, 2, 2]`.
- For `o`, since it's new, `lookup[o] = 3`. The encoding list updates to `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.

The final encoded string representation for `"hello"` is thus `"0, 1, 2, 2, 3"`. As [noted on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/discuss/57941/Python-different-solutions-(dictionary-etc)./331577), this solution is more modular and allows us to potentially solve interesting follow-up questions like "grouping isomorphic strings":

```python
def groupIsomorphic(strs):
    def encode(s):
        lookup = {}
        encoding = []
        for char in s:
            if char not in lookup:
                lookup[char] = len(lookup)
            encoding.append(lookup[char])
        return str(encoding)

    groups = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        encoding = encode(s)
        groups[encoding].append(s)

    return list(groups.values())

print(groupIsomorphic(['aab', 'xxy', 'xyz', 'abc', 'def', 'xyx']))

""" 

[
  ['aab', 'xxy'], 
  ['xyz', 'abc', 'def'], 
  ['xyx']
]

"""
