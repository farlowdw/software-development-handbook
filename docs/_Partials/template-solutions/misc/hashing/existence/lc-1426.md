```python
class Solution:
    def countElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        lookup = set(arr)
        ans = 0
        for num in arr:
            if (num + 1) in lookup:
                ans += 1
        return ans
```

The key idea is to use `lookup` for $O(1)$ lookups. Then membership checks for `x + 1` for any number `x` is constant.

**Time:** $O(n)$. Building the `lookup` set takes $O(n)$ time and subsequently processing each number in `arr` takes $O(n)$ time; hence, overall, the time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The additional space consumed in building the `lookup` set is $O(n)$.
