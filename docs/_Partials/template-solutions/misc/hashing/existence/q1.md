```python
def find_numbers(nums):
    lookup = set(nums)
    res = []

    for num in lookup:
        if (num + 1 not in lookup) and (num - 1 not in lookup):
            res.append(num)
    
    return res
```

First convert `nums` to a set in order to avoid considering non-unique elements. Then process each unique element to see whether or not its "off-by-one" neighbors exist.

**Time:** $O(n)$. It takes $O(n)$ time to build the `lookup` set and $O(n)$ time to process each number, resulting in an overall time complexity of $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(n)$. We consume $O(n)$ additional memory by building the `lookup` set.
