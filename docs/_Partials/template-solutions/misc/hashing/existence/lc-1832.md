```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        for char in sentence:
            seen.add(char)
            if len(seen) == 26:
                return True
        return False
```

The solution above is methodical and does not rely on the built-in `set` command, but we could just as well:

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        return len(set(sentence)) == 26
```

The time and space complexity are the same for both approaches.

**Time:** $O(n)$. We process each character of `sentence`, where `n == len(sentence)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Constructing the set in either solution scales with the input size. Since we're limited to lowercase English letters, we technically have a constant space complexity, but it may be more accurate to say $O(m)$, where $m$ represents the size of the character set(s) that may be valid to use.
