```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        lookup = set(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        for num in range(n + 1):
            if num not in lookup:
                return num
```

The approach above is likely the *intended* solution. Using $O(1)$ lookups means our overall time complexity will be $O(n)$.

**Time:** $O(n)$. We iterate over $n + 1$ numbers in total, meaning our overall time complexity is $O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(n)$. Building the `lookup` set consumes $O(n)$ additional memory.

Just because we *can* solve this problem using a hash map does not mean we should. There are two solutions that are notably better, and they both rely on basic mathematical observations.

Using Gauss's formula (sum of first $n$ positive integers):

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        target_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        actual_sum = sum(nums)
        return target_sum - actual_sum
```

Another effective mathematical approach involves computing a running sum of the first $n$ positive integers &#8212; the *difference* is the missing number:

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        running_sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            running_sum += (i + 1) - nums[i]
        return running_sum
```

Both approaches result in reducing the space complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$.
