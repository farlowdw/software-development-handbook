```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        lookup = set(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        for num in range(n + 1):
            if num not in lookup:
                return num
```

Just because you *can* solve this problem using a hash map does not mean you should. There are two solutions that are notably better, and they both rely on basic mathematical observations.

Using Gauss's formula (sum of first $n$ positive integers):

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        tot_sum = n * (n+1) // 2
        return tot_sum - sum(nums)
```

Another effective mathematical approach involves computing a running sum of the first $n$ positive integers &#8212; the *difference* is the missing number:

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        running_sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            running_sum += (i + 1) - nums[i]
        return running_sum
```
