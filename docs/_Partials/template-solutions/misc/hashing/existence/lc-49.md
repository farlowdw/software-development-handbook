```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        lookup = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            key = "".join(sorted(s))
            lookup[key].append(s)
        return list(lookup.values())
```

It's easier to check if a string is an anagram of another string by determining whether or not the sorted versions of these strings are equivalent. To return the groups of anagrams, we add the sorted version of a string as the key in a hash map (for efficient lookups) and we add the string itself to the group if its sorted version matches a key.
