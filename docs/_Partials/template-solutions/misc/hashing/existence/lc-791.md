```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        for char in s:
            lookup[char] += 1
            
        ans = []
        for char in order:
            if char in lookup:
                for _ in range(lookup[char]):
                    ans.append(char)
                del lookup[char]

        for char in lookup:
            for _ in range(lookup[char]):
                ans.append(char)
            
        return "".join(ans)
```

The idea is to first create a hash map of the character frequencies in `s`. This will let us recreate a permutation of `s` efficiently. Now we simply iterate through `order` from left to right, filling in the `ans` array with the character counts obtained previously. Lastly, since the order does not matter, we can just fill in the rest of the array with the unused characters and their frequencies.
