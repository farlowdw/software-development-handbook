```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedCharacter(self, s: str) -> str:
        seen = set()
        for char in s:
            if char in seen:
                return char
            seen.add(char)
```

The efficiency of the solution above completely relies on the fact that lookups in sets are $O(1)$.

**Time:** $O(n)$. We iterate through all characters in `s`, meaning the overall time complexity is $O(n)$, where `n == len(s)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Building the `seen` lookup set appears to consume $O(n)$ extra memory, but the reality is that `seen` hold at most 26 characters since `s` is comprised of only lowercase English letters. Hence, the space is really $O(26) = O(1)$. But if we don't know the exact character set, then it would be clearer to say the solution above has space complexity $O(n)$ or $O(m)$ where $m$ represents the total number of characters in the character set being considered.
