```python
class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        departures = set()
        destinations = set()
        for path in paths:
            departures.add(path[0])
            destinations.add(path[1])
        
        for destination in destinations:
            if destination not in departures:
                return destination
```

The solution above explicitly answers the question we are trying to answer: which destination city is *not* a departure city? Another more Pythonic solution may be expressed as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        departures, destinations = zip(*paths)
        destination_city = set(destinations) - set(departures)
        return destination_city.pop()
```
