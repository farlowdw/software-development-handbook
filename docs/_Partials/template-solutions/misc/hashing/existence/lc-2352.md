```python
class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        col_lookup = defaultdict(int)
        
        for col in range(n):
            column_vals = []
            for row in range(n):
                column_vals.append(grid[row][col])
            col_lookup[tuple(column_vals)] += 1
        
        ans = 0    
        for row in grid:
            ans += col_lookup[tuple(row)]
        
        return ans
```

This problem is essentially an existence problem. The `col_lookup` hash map tracks the frequency with which the same sequence of column values appears (separate columns with the same sequence of values must be counted separately). Then we simply need to iterate over all rows and add the number of times the equivalent sequence of values appears for columns. Since hash maps generally need to have immutable keys, we use Python's `tuple`.

**Time:** $O(n^2)$. Each number in the `grid` is processed.

**Space:** $O(n^2)$. The worst case scenario is that each column is unique, meaning `col_lookup` is of length `n`, and each member of `col_lookup` is of length `n`.
