```python
class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        row_sols = defaultdict(int)
        ans = 0
        
        for row in grid:
            key = tuple(row)
            row_sols[key] += 1
        
        for col in range(n):
            col_sol = []
            for row in range(n):
                col_sol.append(grid[row][col])
            
            col_sol_str = tuple(col_sol)
            ans += row_sols[col_sol_str]
                
        return ans
```

Even though we're effectively using the hash map to count the number of equivalent row-column pairs, the crux of the problem is an existence once: the keys for our hash map need to be hashable (i.e., usually "immutable" in most languages). Hence, we can use strings, but this is somewhat messy, especially if you have a nice alternative like the `tuple` in Python.
