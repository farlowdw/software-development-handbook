```python
class Solution:
    def minimumCardPickup(self, cards: List[int]) -> int:
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        ans = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(len(cards)):
            card = cards[i]
            if card in lookup:
                ans = min(ans, i - lookup[card] + 1)
            lookup[card] = i
            
        return ans if ans != float('inf') else -1
```

Store the index of each card encountered in the lookup. Once we encounter a match, then we can look at the difference between indices to get the length of the subarray between matches (i.e., the minimum number of consecutive cards we'd need to pick up in order to have a pair of matching cards).

Note that we need to update the index of the card being maintained in the lookup for each iteration because our goal is to find the *minimum* number of consecutive cards we'd need to pick up.

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each card in `cards` is processed, where `n == len(cards)`.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The worst case scenario is when all card values are distinct. The hash map `lookup` grows in proportion to the input.
