```python
class Solution:
    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def digit_sum(num):
            ans = 0
            while num > 0:
                ans += num % 10
                num //= 10
            return ans
        
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        ans = -1
        
        for num in nums:
            key = digit_sum(num)
            if key in lookup:
                ans = max(ans, num + lookup[key])
            lookup[key] = max(num, lookup[key])
        
        return ans
```

Arguably the hardest part of this problem is figuring out a way to not have to sort the numbers. Should we start by sorting all numbers as a pre-processing step? Should we sort each list of numbers after we've added them all to the hash map, where keys are digit sums?

Fortunately, we do not actually need to sort the numbers. Since we're looking for the *maximum* value of `nums[i] + nums[j]`, our hash map can simply keep track of the largest number encountered thus far for any given digit sum. Then, once we encounter the digit sum again, we can check whether or not the overall answer needs to be updated, but every iteration we update key value for a digit sum to be the largest positive integer we've seen thus far for that digit sum. This effectively allows us to *not* have to sort the numbers at all.
