```python
class Solution:
    def areOccurrencesEqual(self, s: str) -> bool:
        freqs = defaultdict(int)
        for char in s:
            freqs[char] += 1
            
        return len(set(freqs.values())) == 1
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. It costs $O(n)$ time to construct the `freqs` hash map, and it costs $O(n)$ time to convert the key values in `freqs` to a set; hence, the overall time complexity is given by $O(2n) = O(n)$, where `n == len(s)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. If the input only consists of lowercase English letters, then $O(26) = O(1)$, but it might be more accurate to say the space complexity is $O(m)$, where $m$ is the total size of the character set(s) under consideration.
