```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        for char in stones:
            lookup[char] += 1
            
        ans = 0
        for char in jewels:
            ans += lookup[char]
            
        return ans
```

Add the frequency of each stone encountered to a lookup hash map. Then use that lookup to iterate through the jewels, adding the frequency to the answer for each iteration (the characters of `jewels` are unique).

**Time:** $O(n)$. We process all characters in both `stones` and `jewels`, where `n == len(stones)`, and we assume `stones` has a greater size than `jewels`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The character set is limited, but we can also say $O(k)$ to accommodate more character sets.
