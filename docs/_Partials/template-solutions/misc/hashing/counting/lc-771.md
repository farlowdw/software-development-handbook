```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        for char in stones:
            lookup[char] += 1
            
        ans = 0
        for char in jewels:
            ans += lookup[char]
            
        return ans
```

Add the frequency of each stone encountered to a lookup hash map. Then use that lookup to iterate through the jewels, adding the frequency to the answer for each iteration (the characters of `jewels` are unique).
