```python
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        wins = defaultdict(int)
        losses = defaultdict(int)
        
        for winner, loser in matches:
            wins[winner] += 1
            losses[loser] += 1
            
        ans = [[],[]]
        for winner in wins:
            if winner not in losses:
                ans[0].append(winner)
        for loser in losses:
            if losses[loser] == 1:
                ans[1].append(loser)
                
        return [sorted(ans[0]), sorted(ans[1])]
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. If we let `n == len(matches)`, then there's a maximum possibility of $2n$ distinct numbers for the players involved. Each match is processed, and then all winners and losers are processed. Subsequently, both sublists satisfying the criteria are sorted and returned. Prior to sorting, the time cost is $O(n)$, and the separate sorts are a maximum of $O(n\log n)$. Together, the cumulative time cost is thus $O(n\log n)$.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The hash maps built scale linearly with the input.
