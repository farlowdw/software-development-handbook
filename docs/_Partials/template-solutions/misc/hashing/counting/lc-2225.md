```python
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        losses = defaultdict(int)
        for winner, loser in matches:
            losses[loser] += 1
            if winner not in losses:
                losses[winner] = 0
                
        ans = [[],[]]
        for loser in losses:
            if losses[loser] == 0:
                ans[0].append(loser)
            elif losses[loser] == 1:
                ans[1].append(loser)
        
        return [sorted(ans[0]), sorted(ans[1])]
```

**Time:** $O(n\log n)$. If we let `n == len(matches)`, then there's a maximum possibility of $2n$ distinct numbers for the players involved. Prior to sorting, the time cost is $O(n)$, and the separate sorts are a maximum of $O(n\log n)$. Together, the cumulative time cost is thus $O(n\log n)$.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The hash map `losses` scales linearly with the input.
