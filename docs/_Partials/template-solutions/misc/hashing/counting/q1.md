You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Find the length of the longest substring that contains **at most** `k` distinct characters.

For example, given `s = "eceba"` and `k = 2`, return `3`. The longest substring with at most `2` distinct characters is `"ece"`.

```python
def find_longest_substring(s, k):
    lookup = defaultdict(int)
    left = ans = 0
    
    for right in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        lookup[s[right - 1]] += 1
        while left < right and len(lookup) > k:
            lookup[s[left]] -= 1
            if lookup[s[left]] == 0:
                del lookup[s[left]]
            left += 1
        ans = max(ans, right - left)
    
    return ans
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `left` and `right` pointers move a maximum of $n$ units each, where `n == len(s)`; hence, the total time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. This is technically the case if we limit ourselves to the lowercase English alphabet since $O(26) = O(1)$, but we really should have something like $O(m)$, where $m$ represents the total size of the character set(s) under consideration. Or, for this specific problem, $O(k)$ might be the most accurate since the algorithm will delete elements from the hash map once its size grows beyond $k$.
