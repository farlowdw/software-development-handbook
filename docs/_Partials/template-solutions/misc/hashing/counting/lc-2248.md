        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        for arr in nums:
            for num in arr:
                lookup[num] += 1
                
        ans = []
        for key in lookup:
            if lookup[key] == len(nums):
                ans.append(key)
                
        return sorted(ans)
```

The solution above is a clean hashing-based solution that is flexible regardless of what numbers we consider.

**Time:** $O(m\cdot(n + \log m))$. This assumes `nums` is comprised of $n$ lists, each list of which has an average or maximum of $m$ elements. It costs $O(nm)$ to iterate over all elements, and the answer array at the end can only hold a maximum of $m$ elements; hence, the overall time complexity is given by $O(nm + m\log m) = O(m\cdot(n+\log m))$.

**Space:** $O(nm)$. If every single element is unique in the input, then the `lookup` hash map will grow to a size of $O(nm)$.

<ChipDivider>Array-based solutin to improve time complexity</ChipDivider> 

We can improve the time complexity by using an array-based approach that takes advantage of the fact we're told `1000` is the maximum possible number in the input:

```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        freqs = [0] * 1001
        for arr in nums:
            for num in arr:
                freqs[num] += 1
        
        res = []
        for i in range(1001):
            if freqs[i] == n:
                res.append(i)
                
        return res
```

The solution above reduces the overall runtime to $O(nm)$.
