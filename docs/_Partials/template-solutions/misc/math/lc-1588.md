<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

The solution above probably seems like witchcraft. To understand the spell, first consider what a general array of length `n` looks like, where `0 <= i <= n - 1` (the array shown below really just shows the index values):

$$
\texttt{nums} = [0,1,\ldots,i-1,i,i+1,\ldots,n-1]
$$

Let `A` denote any odd-length subarray in `nums` centered at `i`. Consider what the composition of any such subarray looks like:

$$
[
  \underbrace{
  \overbrace{\ldots}^{\substack{\text{prefix elements}\\\text{not in }\texttt{A}}},\quad
  \underbrace{
  \overbrace{\ldots}^{\substack{\texttt{left\_side}\\\text{elements in }\texttt{A}\\\text{but left of }\texttt{i}}},\quad
  \texttt{i},\quad
  \overbrace{\ldots}^{\substack{\texttt{right\_side}\\\text{elements in }\texttt{A}\\\text{but right of }\texttt{i}}}}_{\texttt{A}},\quad
  \overbrace{\ldots}^{\substack{\text{suffix elements}\\\text{not in }\texttt{A}}}}_{\texttt{nums}}
]
$$

The important observation to make here is that the lengths of `left_side` and `right_side` must have the same [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)). That is, the number of elements in `left_side` and `right_side` must *both* be either even or odd. To see why this must be, note that the subarray of length `1` centered at `i` is an odd-length subarray; thus, if `left_side` and `right_side` are both odd in size, then we have the following in terms of integer arithmetic:

```
odd + odd + odd = even + odd = odd
```

Similarly, if `left_side` and `right_side` are both even in isze, then we have the following:

```
even + odd + even = odd + even = odd
```

In either case, we end up with an odd-sized subarray.

But how can we actually compute the number of elements to the left or right of the subarray centered at index `i`? At first glance, it seems like we may need to consider whether or not the total number of elements in `nums` is odd/even as well as whether or not `i` itself is odd/even. This can lead to some really messy case analysis. But let's try to simplify the matter first by drawing things out. Let's observe how many elements there are to the left and right of `i` regardless of what happens:

$$
\texttt{nums} = [\overbrace{0,1,\ldots,i-1}^{i\text{ elements}},i,\overbrace{i+1,\ldots,n-1}^{\substack{(n-1)-(i+1) + 1=\\[0.25em] n-i-1\text{ elements}}}]
$$

The above is true no matter what. We will *always* have `i` elements to the left of the element at index `i`, and we will *always* have `n - i - 1` elements to the right of the element at index `i`. How does this observation help?

Recall what we need for a subarray centered at `i` to be odd in length: the elements to its left and right must be either both even in size or both odd in size. 

- `even_left`: How many ways are there to use an even number of elements to the left of `i`? It's easier to answer this question if we imagine starting at `i` and trying to extend to the left by `2` elements at a time &#8212; then our question becomes how many 2-elements "blocks" there are to the left of `i`. Since there are `i` elements to the left of `i`, there are `i // 2` blocks of length `2` that can be used to make `even_left` an even-size subarray. But we need to add `1` to account for the case where we add no elements at all to the left of `i`. So we ultimately have `even_left = (i // 2) + 1`. 

  To see this more concretely, suppose we have the array `[12, 15, 13, 17, 16, 22, 25]`, and we're currently at element `22` which resides at `i = 5`. Then there are `5` elements to the left of `22`. Our work above tells us there are `(i // 2) + 1 = (5 // 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3` ways to have a subarray of even length to the left of `22`. Let's see. Not extending to the left at all leaves us with `[22]`. If we now extend `2` elements to the left, we get the subarray `[17, 16, 22]`. And if we extend again we get the subarray `[15, 13, 17, 16, 22]`. But that's all we can extend to get even-length subarrays `[]`, `[17, 16]`, `[15, 13, 17, 16]` to the left of `[22]`.

- `even_right`: The same logic used above can be applied to the right-hand side: we get `even_right = ((n - i - 1) // 2) + 1`.
- `odd_left`: We have to be a little careful here. Suppose we again have the array `[12, 15, 13, 17, 16, 22, 25]` but this time we're at `15` where `i = 1`. Then how many ways can we form an odd-length subarray to the left of `15`? There's clearly only `1` way to do this: include `12`. But if we used the calculation `i // 2`, then we'd get `i // 2 = 1 // 2 = 0`, which is not the desired result. Instead of taking the floor, where `1 // 2` is equivalent to `math.floor(1 / 2)`, we need to take the *ceiling*, where `math.ceil(1 / 2)` would yield `1`, as desired &#8212; this will let us accurately capture the number of ways that exist for forming odd-length subarrays to the left of the element at index `i`. Of course, most languages do not have built-in support for the ceiling operation, but we can achieve the same result by [creatively using integer division](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32559082/5209533) as follows: `math.ceil(a / b) == -(a // -b)`. This means `odd_left = math.ceil(i / 2) = -(i // -2)`. Note that we could also achieve our desired result by simply adding `1` to `i` to offset what we lose by performing integer division: `odd_left = (i + 1) // 2`. Either way will suffice.
- `odd_right`: The same logic remarked on above applies to the right-hand side: `odd_right = math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2) = -((n - i - 1) // -2)`. We could also achieve this result by adding `1` to the number of elements to the right, as we did for `odd_left`, which would give us `odd_right = ((n - i - 1) + 1) // 2 = (n - i) // 2`.

All that remains is to combine the information above in a meaningful way:

- Any number of the `even_left` ways can be applied *in combination* with the number of ways in `even_right`, which means we have a total of `even_left * even_right` ways of chosing an even number of elements to the left and/or right of the element at index `i`. Note that we account for the one-element subarray `[nums[i]]` when `even_left` and `even_right` are both `0`.
- Similarly, any number of the `odd_left` ways can be applied *in combination* with the number of ways in `odd_right`, which means we have a total of `odd_left * odd_right` ways of chosing an odd number of elements to the left and/or right of the element at index `i`.

Adding these combinations together means we can find the total *contribution* of the current element to the overall sum of all odd-length subarrays as follows:

```python
nums[i] * (odd_left * odd_right + even_left * even_right)
```

One nice thing here is how easily our solution could be adapted to finding the sum of all even-length subarrays. For such a situation, `left_side` and `right_side` would need to be *opposite* parities, meaning the total contribution to the overall sum by any given element would be as follows:

```python
nums[i] * (odd_left * even_right + even_left * odd_right)
```
