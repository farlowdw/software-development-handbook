```python
class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nums = nums
        self.prefix = [self.nums[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(self.nums)):
            self.prefix.append(self.nums[i] + self.prefix[-1])

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix[right] - self.prefix[left] + self.nums[left]
```

The code above is arguably the easiest to read and maintain. Below is an alternative way to bypass the declaration of `self.nums`:

```python
class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix = [0, nums[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            self.prefix.append(nums[i] + self.prefix[-1])

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix[right + 1] - self.prefix[left]
```

This works by effectively shifting the entire prefix sum array by a single unit to the right. Normally, if we wanted to find the sum of the subarray between `left` and `right`, inclusive, where presumably `left <= right`, then we would need to compute `prefix[right] - prefix[left - 1]` or `prefix[right] - prefix[left] + arr[left]` (this latter option being the preferred method when `left` is the left endpoint). 

The alternative solution above eliminates the problem caused by the potential boundary issue of `left` being the left endpoint: since the prefix array is a prefix *sum*, then including an extra summand of `0` does not impact things (similarly, if we had a prefix product, then including a value of `1` at the beginning would not change things).
