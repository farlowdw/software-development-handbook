```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = nums[i] + nums[i - 1]
        return nums
```

This is basically *the* quintessential prefix sum problem since we're tasked with *creating* a prefix sum array.

**Time:** $O(n)$. We iterate over all elements of `nums` (except the first element); hence, if `n == len(nums)`, then our solution is $O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The solution above constructs the prefix sum array in-place and thus does not use any additional memory.

The following is also a very viable solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        prefix = [nums[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            prefix.append(nums[i] + prefix[-1])
        return prefix
```

The time complexity is still $O(n)$, but the space complexity is now also $O(n)$ since we built the prefix sum array from scratch.
