```python
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start_val = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[i] += nums[i - 1]
            start_val = min(start_val, nums[i])
        return -start_val + 1 if start_val <= 0 else 1
```

This is a fun one. The *result* we need to consider is binary in nature: the lowest value encountered when cumulatively summing elements is either non-positive (i.e., negative or zero), whereby we need to reverse the sign of the lowest value and then add `1` (so as to ensure the returned value is positive) or the lowest value is itself positive and we can simply return `1`.

Regardless, we do not need the original `nums` array &#8212; we can mutate it into a prefix sum that we process as we build the prefix sum. Hence, the code above is $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.
