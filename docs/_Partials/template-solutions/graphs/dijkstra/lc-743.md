In some ways, this is sort of a quintessential Dijkstra problem. We need to minimize the path from the source node, `k`, to all other nodes. Since nodes are numbered `1` through `n`, inclusive, we pretend as if there are `n + 1` nodes in order to simplify the mechanics &#8212; we subsequently set the time cost for the dummy node and source node to `0` (i.e., nodes `0` and `k`, respectively).

**Time:** TBD

**Space:** TBD
