The main twist for Dijkstra in this problem is that the cheapest path to any given node may be valid or invalid based on the number of stops required to get there. We need to handle cheapest path determinations carefully. The "normal" Dijkstra algorithm would suffice if we had $k = \infty$ (i.e., if we allowed an infinite number of stops) because the problem is simply reduced to a traditional shortest path problem. But when there is a limit on the number of stops, `k`, the problem becomes more complex because it's not just about finding the shortest path but the shortest path within a constrained number of stops. This constraint fundamentally changes the nature of the problem (and hence the nature of our Dijkstra implementation): We can no longer simply use the shortest distance *globally* (i.e., just using a `distances` array) &#8212; we need to keep the best possible distance for each node considering the number of stops used to get there.

This means we need to use a data structure that can record both the cumulative total cost to get to a node as well as the number of stops involved. In the solution above, we use the following structure:

```python
cost = [[float('inf')] * (k + 2) for _ in range(n)]
```

In the context of the flight problem, a "stop" means a node visited on the path from the source to the destination, not the act of moving from one node to another. Hence, if our path were `0 -> 1 -> 2`, then there is only one "stop" even though three nodes are involved. If we have `n` nodes and `k` stops, then `cost` will look like

```python
cost = [
  # [ before first stop, first stop, ..., last stop, after last stop ] # node 0
  # [ before first stop, first stop, ..., last stop, after last stop ] # node 1
  # ...
  # [ before first stop, first stop, ..., last stop, after last stop ] # node n - 1
]
```

where each of the `n` entries are `k + 2` units long (with all default values equal to `inf`). We fill the `cost` array for each node, where each of the `k + 2` slots indicate the minimum cost for reaching that node in that many stops. Hence, the source node will have a cost of `0` in its first slot because we begin at that point with no associated cost. The first slot for all other nodes is `inf` because there's no way to reach such nodes *before the first stop*. 

For the sake of optimization, as soon as the destination node is popped from the priority queue, we should return `curr_cost` because this cost is guaranteed to represent the cheapest path to the destination node.

The following solution is also a viable way of approaching this problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        def build_graph(edge_list):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for source, destination, price in edge_list:
                graph[source].append((destination, price))
            return graph
        
        graph = build_graph(flights)
        min_heap = [(0, 0, src)] # cost, stops, node
        costs = {(src, 0): 0} # (node, num_stops): cost ... min cost to get to node in num_stops stops
        
        while min_heap:
            curr_cost, curr_stops, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            if node == dst:
                return curr_cost
            
            if curr_stops <= k:
                for neighbor, price in graph[node]:
                    new_cost = curr_cost + price
                    new_stops = curr_stops + 1
                    
                    if (neighbor, new_stops) not in costs or new_cost < costs[(neighbor, new_stops)]:
                        costs[(neighbor, new_stops)] = new_cost
                        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_cost, new_stops, neighbor))
                        
        return -1
```
