                    contribution = 4
                    ISLAND_FOUND = True

                        contribution -= 2
                        
                    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] == LAND:
                        contribution -= 2
                        
                    island_perimeter += contribution
                    
            if ISLAND_FOUND and not ROW_ISLAND:
                return island_perimeter
            
        return island_perimeter
```

The [editorial solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/solution/) (approach 2) explains the procedure above effectively. The idea is to purposely count each square as contributing `4` to the total parameter but to subtract away `2` when required (we only have to look at squares up and to the left since we're processing the grid top to bottom and from left to right):

<div align='center' class='centeredImageDiv' >
  <ImageCarousel images={carouselImages} variableHeight={false} customWidth={360} customHeight='auto' />
</div>

This approach is really quite clever and hard to imagine coming up with in an interview (the `WATER` variable above is not necessary and is included mostly for the sake of clarity). A more likely solution would be the following where each square's perimeter contribution is directly calculated (we start with a contribution of `4` for each square, as above, but we subtract away `1` whenever adjacent land is encountered):

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        WATER = 0
        LAND = 1
        
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        island_perimeter = 0
        ISLAND_FOUND = False
        
        for row in range(rows):
            ROW_ISLAND = False
            for col in range(cols):
                if grid[row][col] == LAND:
                    contribution = 4
                    ISLAND_FOUND = True
                    ROW_ISLAND = True

                    up = WATER if row == 0 else grid[row - 1][col]
                    down = WATER if row == rows - 1 else grid[row + 1][col]
                    left = WATER if col == 0 else grid[row][col - 1]
                    right = WATER if col == cols - 1 else grid[row][col + 1]
                        
                    island_perimeter += (contribution - (up + down + left + right))
                    
            if ISLAND_FOUND and not ROW_ISLAND:
                return island_perimeter
            
        return island_perimeter
```

The real trap for this problem is to immediately pursue an overly complicated DFS solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def in_bounds(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n
        
        def is_water(row, col):
            return not in_bounds(row, col) or grid[row][col] == 0
        
        def is_land(row, col):
            return in_bounds(row, col) and grid[row][col] == 1
        
        def find_island(mat):
            for i in range(m):
                for j in range(n):
                    if mat[i][j] == 1:
                        return i, j
                    
        def perimeter_contribution(row, col):
            above = row - 1, col
            below = row + 1, col
            left = row, col - 1
            right = row, col + 1
            
            perimeter = 0
            
            if is_water(*above):
                perimeter += 1
            if is_water(*below):
                perimeter += 1
            if is_water(*left):
                perimeter += 1
            if is_water(*right):
                perimeter += 1
                
            return perimeter
        
        def dfs(row, col):
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                next_row, next_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if (next_row, next_col) not in seen and is_land(next_row, next_col):
                    nonlocal total_perimeter
                    total_perimeter += perimeter_contribution(next_row, next_col)
                    seen.add((next_row, next_col))
                    dfs(next_row, next_col)
            
        dirs = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        island_entry = find_island(grid)
        seen = {(island_entry)}
        total_perimeter = perimeter_contribution(*island_entry)
        dfs(*island_entry)
        
        return total_perimeter
```

The solution above would be more relevant if we were tasked with, say, finding the *maximum perimeter* of a number of different islands (i.e., connected components).
