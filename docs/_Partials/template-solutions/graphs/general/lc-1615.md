                    rank -= 1

It's easy to get tripped up in this problem and immediately spring for a DFS, where we then count the total number of outdegrees for neighboring nodes (minus 1 to not overcount the shared outdegree to each other), but the fatal flaw here is highlighted in the problem's third example on LeetCode: 

> All the cities *do not have to be connected*.

This means the approach remarked on above will work for cities that are connected, but it will not work for cities that are not connected. If cities are not connected, then we'll want the sum of the outdegrees for two cities and we won't have to subtract 1 because no edge will be shared between them. Point being: there's not a nice way of dealing with this problem other than iterating through all pairs of points to see what the maximal combination is. The rank of each pair is the sum of their outdegrees and *then* we subtract 1 if they happen to be neighbors (this is why the adjacency representation of the graph uses sets for neighbors instead of lists).
