```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestSetOfVertices(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        indegrees = [0] * n
        for _, destination in edges:
            indegrees[destination] += 1
            
        return [ node for node in range(n) if indegrees[node] == 0 ]
```

Arguably the hardest part of this problem is actually understanding what it's really asking for:

> Find *the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable*. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists. Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

What does this really mean? It essentially means that *all nodes that have no inbound neighboring nodes* will comprise the smallest set of vertices we seek. How? Because these nodes only have *outbound* connections to all other nodes (they are not reachable from any other nodes). Hence, the problem boils down to finding all nodes that have an indegree of `0`, as demonstrated above.
