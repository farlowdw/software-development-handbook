```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(trust) < n - 1:
            return -1
        
        def sum_in_out_degrees(edges):
            degree_sum = defaultdict(int)
            for truster, trusted in edges:
                degree_sum[truster] -= 1    # subtract 1 for outdegree
                degree_sum[trusted] += 1    # add 1 for indegree
            return degree_sum
        
        lookup = sum_in_out_degrees(trust)
        for person in range(1, n + 1):
            if lookup[person] == n - 1:
                return person
        return -1
```

This is a great problem where you can really get creative in how you solve it. The key insight is to recognize that the town judge, if that person exists, must have an indegree of `n - 1` and an outdegree of `0`. We can go about computing that in a few different ways, but the approach above is slick in that it tracks the degree total for each person, where `1` is added if the person is *being trusted* or subtracts `1` if the person is *doing the trusting*. 

The result is that the town judge will have a degree total of `n - 1` (i.e., this person is *being trusted* `n - 1` times while having never trusted anyone), but this cannot be possible for anyone else. A longer, slightly less efficient approach (albeit in the same complexity classes in terms of time and space) is to separately maintain the indegree and outdegree counts:

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(trust) < n - 1:
            return -1
        
        def degree_lookup(edges):
            lookup = defaultdict(lambda: [0,0]) # [indegree, outdegree]
            for truster, trusted in edges:
                lookup[truster][1] += 1
                lookup[trusted][0] += 1
            return lookup
        
        lookup = degree_lookup(trust)
        for person in range(1, n + 1):
            if lookup[person][0] == n - 1 and lookup[person][1] == 0:
                return person
            
        return -1
```
