```python
class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, startGene: str, endGene: str, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        seen = {startGene}
        bank = set(bank)
        queue = deque([(startGene, 0)])
        while queue:
            node, mutations = queue.popleft()
            if node == endGene:
                return mutations
            
            for char in 'ACGT':
                for i in range(8):
                    neighbor = node[:i] + char + node[i+1:]
                    if neighbor not in seen and neighbor in bank:
                        seen.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append((neighbor, mutations + 1))
                    
        return -1
```

It's easy to over-complicate this problem. The core idea is that each gene is a node and nodes are connected by single-difference mutations. The solution above uses the `if neighbor not in seen` to its advantage to effectively bypass logic for avoiding the consideration of the *same gene* more than once. That is, `for char in 'ACGT'` means `char` will obviously take on values `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'` even though the character for the *current* gene in this place is one of these characters. But since the the current node has already been seen, we will not continue a search from it. It's a clever way to simplify the rest of the logic. The `8` in `for i in range(8)` is due to the fact that each gene string is `8` characters long.

Here's a longer and more complicated (not recommended) solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, startGene: str, endGene: str, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        def get_neighbors(node):
            neighbors = []
            for i in range(8):
                for j in range(3):
                    char_mutation = code_to_char[(char_to_code[node[i]] + (j + 1)) % 4]
                    gene_mutation = node[:i] + char_mutation + node[i+1:]
                    if gene_mutation in bank:
                        neighbors.append(gene_mutation)
            return neighbors
        
        char_to_code = { 'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3 }
        code_to_char = { 0: 'A', 1: 'C', 2: 'G', 3: 'T' }
        bank = set(bank)
        
        seen = {startGene}
        queue = deque([(startGene, 0)])
        while queue:
            node, mutations = queue.popleft()
            if node == endGene:
                return mutations
            
            for neighbor in get_neighbors(node):
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, mutations + 1))
                    
        return -1
```
