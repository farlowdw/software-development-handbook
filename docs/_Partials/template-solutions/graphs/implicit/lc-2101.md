Time to remember what the distance between two points is! But for real. The idea here is that each bomb is a node and bomb `A` is connected to bomb `B` if bomb `B` lies within bomb `A`'s blast radius (and vice-verse, indicating we should use a directed graph to model this problem). We then explore what happens when any single bomb is detonated &#8212; how many bombs in total will be detonated after any *one* bomb is detonated? We want the maximum.

We can use a BFS or DFS to answer this question here. The approach above uses a BFS. One small edge case to be aware of is that nothing prevents two bombs from being placed at the exact same location *and* with the same radius; that is, the entries in `bombs` will be identical, but they will need to be treated separately. Hence, when we build our graph, we should use each bomb's *index* as its node label as opposed to a tuple for the bomb. Just because a tuple is immutable/hashable does not mean we should use it in such a way; additionally, if we use tuples for each bomb, then we fail to take into account when two bombs can be in the same location and with the same radius.
