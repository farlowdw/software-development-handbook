```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        def neighbors(node):
            ans = []
            for i in range(4):
                num = int(node[i])
                for change in [-1, 1]:
                    x = (num + change) % 10
                    ans.append(node[:i] + str(x) + node[i + 1:])
            
            return ans

        if "0000" in deadends:
            return -1
        
        queue = deque([("0000", 0)])
        seen = set(deadends)
        seen.add("0000")
        
        while queue:
            node, steps = queue.popleft()
            if node == target:
                return steps
        
            for neighbor in neighbors(node):
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))
        
        return -1
```

The solution above is quite Pythonic. The key insight in this problem is to view each combination as a node or state we want to visit *once*. A node's neighbors will be all nodes *one* letter change away. The trickier part of the problem becomes making the string manipulations effectively and actually generating the neighbors. The `neighbors` function above does this effectively even though `(num + change) % 10` seems odd at first because of how Python's modulus operator `%` operates &#8212; [its definition is floored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo#In_programming_languages), which means, for example, that `-1 % 10 == 9`. In general, floored division means the remainder procured by the modulus operator will always have the same sign as the divisor. We could change `(num + change) % 10` to `(num + change + 10) % 10` to explicitly avoid this confusion if we wanted to.

Another approach is much less clean but also still effective in achieving the desired end result:

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        def dial_up_down(str_num):
            num = int(str_num)
            if 1 <= num <= 8:
                return str(num - 1), str(num + 1)
            else:
                if num == 0:
                    return '9', '1'
                else:
                    return '8', '0'
        
        seen = {'0000'}
        deadends = set(deadends)
        queue = deque([('0000', 0)])
        
        if target in deadends or '0000' in deadends:
            return -1
        
        while queue:
            combination, moves = queue.popleft()
            if combination == target:
                return moves
            
            candidates = []
            combination = list(combination)
            for i in range(len(combination)):
                char = combination[i]
                up, down = dial_up_down(char)
                new_candidate_up = combination[:]
                new_candidate_up[i] = up
                new_candidate_down = combination[:]
                new_candidate_down[i] = down
                candidates.append("".join(new_candidate_up))
                candidates.append("".join(new_candidate_down))
                
            for candidate in candidates:
                if candidate not in seen and candidate not in deadends:
                    seen.add(candidate)
                    queue.append((candidate, moves + 1))
                    
        return -1
```
