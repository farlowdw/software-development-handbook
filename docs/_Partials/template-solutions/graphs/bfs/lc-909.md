```python
class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < n and 0 <= col < n
        
        def label_to_cell(num):
            row = (num - 1) // n
            col = (num - 1) % n
            if row % 2 == 1:
                col = (n - 1) - col
            return [(n - 1) - row, col]
        
        n = len(board)
        seen = {1}
        queue = deque([(1,0)])
        while queue:
            label, moves = queue.popleft()
            
            if label == n ** 2:
                return moves
            
            for next_label in range(label + 1, min(label + 6, n ** 2) + 1):
                row, col = label_to_cell(next_label)
                if valid(row, col) and next_label not in seen:
                    seen.add(next_label)
                    if board[row][col] != -1:
                        queue.append((board[row][col], moves + 1))
                    else:
                        queue.append((next_label, moves + 1))
                        
        return -1
```

This is a rough one, mostly because of the convoluted problem description. The trickiest part is coming up with a performant way of converting from label to cell:

```python
def label_to_cell(num):
    row = (num - 1) // n
    col = (num - 1) % n
    if row % 2 == 1:
        col = (n - 1) - col
    return [(n - 1) - row, col]
```

Coming up with the function above takes some patience and experimentation at first. Another challenge is the mental change from generally recording in the `seen` set the position of the node we're processing; in this case, we only care about what node *labels* we've previously seen. As we explore neighbors, we add each label to the `seen` set, but the items we add to the queue will depend on whether or not we've encounter a snake or ladder.
