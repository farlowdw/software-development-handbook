The [solution editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/solution/) makes it clear there are several ways of going about solving this problem. The approach above is arguably more straightforward than the solutions provided in the editorial though.

The key idea is to pre-process the grid in order to find the total number of fresh oranges as well as where the rotten oranges are located (if no fresh oranges are found, then immediately return `0`) &#8212; we then execute a mult-source BFS from each rotten orange, and we keep track of how many fresh oranges remain as each cell is processed (if the counter ever reaches `0`, then we immediately return the number of minutes required at that point).
