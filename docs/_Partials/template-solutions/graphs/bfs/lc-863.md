```python
class Solution:
    def distanceK(self, root: TreeNode, target: TreeNode, k: int) -> List[int]:
        def build_parent_lookup(node, parent = None):
            if not node:
                return
            
            parent_lookup[node] = parent
            build_parent_lookup(node.left, node)
            build_parent_lookup(node.right, node)
            
        parent_lookup = dict()
        build_parent_lookup(root)
        seen = {target}
        
        queue = deque([target])
        for _ in range(k):
            num_nodes_this_level = len(queue)
            for _ in range(num_nodes_this_level):
                node = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in [node.left, node.right, parent_lookup[node]]:
                    if neighbor and neighbor not in seen:
                        seen.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return [ node.val for node in queue ]
```

The key in the solution above is to recognize that a BFS traversal will give us exactly what we want *if* we have some way to reference each node's parent node. The `build_parent_lookup` function, which uses DFS to build a hashmap lookup for each node's parent node, gives us this. Much of the rest of the problem then becomes a standard BFS traversal.
