```python
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n and mat[row][col] == 1
        
        m = len(mat)
        n = len(mat[0])
        res = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        dirs = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
        seen = set()
        queue = deque()
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if mat[i][j] == 0:
                    seen.add((i, j))
                    queue.append((i, j, 0))
                    
        while queue:
            row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                next_row, next_col = row + dr, col + dc
                next_node = (next_row, next_col)
                if valid(*next_node) and next_node not in seen:
                    res[next_row][next_col] = dist + 1
                    seen.add(next_node)
                    queue.append((*next_node, dist + 1))
        
        return res
```

The solution above takes advantage of a so-called *multi-source BFS* (i.e., a BFS traversal with multiple starting sources). The solution also takes advantage of the fact that cells with a value of `0` *do not need to be updated*; hence, our BFS can *start* from all nodes with a value of `0` and explore outwards, updating non-zero nodes (i.e., just nodes with value `1` for this problem) with the distance so far from a node with value `0`. Our intuition tells us to start from the nodes with value `1`, but it's much easier to start from the nodes with value `0`.

Additionally, in the `valid` function above, the condition `and mat[row][col] == 1` is not necessary since *all* nodes with value `0` are added to the `seen` set before exploring outwards, which means all subsequent nodes we'll explore that are both valid and *not* in `seen` will have a non-zero value (i.e., `1` for this problem). This conditional of the `valid` function is only kept for the sake of clarity, but it's worth noting that it's not necessary here.
