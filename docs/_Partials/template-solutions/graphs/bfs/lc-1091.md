        n = len(grid)
        seen = {(0,0)}

        while queue:
            row, col, path_length = queue.popleft()
            if row == n - 1 and col == n - 1:
                return path_length
            
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                next_row, next_col = row + dr, col + dc
                next_node = (next_row, next_col)
                if valid(*next_node) and next_node not in seen:
                    queue.append((*next_node, path_length + 1))

It's fairly conventional in BFS solutions for graphs to encode with each node additional information like the current level for that node or some other kind of *stateful* data. We do not need to encode anything other than each node's position in the `seen` set because whenever we encounter a node it will be in the fewest steps possible (i.e., the trademark of BFS solutions ... finding shortest paths).
