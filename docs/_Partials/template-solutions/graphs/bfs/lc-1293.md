This is an excellent problem for thinking through how a node's *state* should be recorded in the `seen` set; that is, the majority of BFS and DFS traversals on matrix graphs simply record a node's *position* (i.e., row and column) because the node's position fully describes the state we do not want to visit again. But for some problems, like this one, it's helpful to record more information than just a node's position. Specifically, the *state* we do not want to visit more than once is a node's position *in addition to* the number of remaining obstacles we can move.

Thinking about using the `seen` set to record *states* we do not want to visit multiple times is much more accurate and reflective of our actual goal &#8212; only perform computation when absolutely necessary.
