```python
class Solution:
    def shortestAlternatingPaths(self, n: int, redEdges: List[List[int]], blueEdges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        def build_graph(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                graph[node].append(neighbor)
            return graph
        
        RED_GRAPH = build_graph(redEdges)
        BLUE_GRAPH = build_graph(blueEdges)
        RED = 1
        BLUE = 0
        
        ans = [float('inf')] * n
        seen = {(0,RED), (0,BLUE)}
        queue = deque([(0,RED,0),(0,BLUE,0)])
            
        while queue:
            node, color, steps = queue.popleft()
            ans[node] = min(ans[node], steps)
            alt_color = 1 - color
            graph = RED_GRAPH if alt_color == 1 else BLUE_GRAPH
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if (neighbor, alt_color) not in seen:
                    seen.add((neighbor, alt_color))
                    queue.append((neighbor, alt_color, steps + 1))
                    
        return [ val if val != float('inf') else -1 for val in ans ]
```

This is such a great problem in so many ways. The idea is to execute a "semi-multi-source" BFS, where we start with node `0` as if it's red as well as if it's blue. Then we expand outwards.

We also take advantage of a nice numerical trick: `1 - 1 == 0`, and `1 - 0 == 1`. This allows us to effectively (and efficiently) alternate between colors.
