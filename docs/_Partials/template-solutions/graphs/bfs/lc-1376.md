```python
class Solution:
    def numOfMinutes(self, n: int, headID: int, manager: List[int], informTime: List[int]) -> int:
        # treat the graph as directed (from managers to subordinates)
        def build_adj_list(manager_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for emp in range(n):
                graph[manager_arr[emp]].append(emp)
            del graph[-1]
            return graph
        
        graph = build_adj_list(manager)
        minutes_needed = informTime[headID]
        seen = {headID}
        queue = deque([(headID, 0)]) # unique base case
        
        while queue:
            manager, time_so_far = queue.popleft()
            for subordinate in graph[manager]:
                minutes_needed = max(minutes_needed, time_so_far + informTime[manager])
                seen.add(subordinate)
                queue.append((subordinate, time_so_far + informTime[manager]))
                
        return minutes_needed
```

This seems like a mostly natural BFS problem, but one of the tricks involves effectively handling how `queue` is initialized. It's tempting to do `queue = deque([(headID, informTime[headID])])`, but this would be wrong when subordinates exist because we almost certainly end up overcounting (this is because `time_so_far + informTime[manager]` is the time so far for each subordinate node of a manager).

Sometimes BFS problems can be tricky because of how we handle queue initialization. This is definitely one of those problems.
