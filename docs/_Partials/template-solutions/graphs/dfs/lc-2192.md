```python
class Solution:
    def getAncestors(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def build_rev_adj_list(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node, visited):
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor, visited)
            return visited
        
        graph = build_rev_adj_list(edges)
        return [ sorted(list(dfs(node, set()))) for node in range(n) ]
```

This is a fun one. The key idea is to *invert* or reverse the edge directions and then perform a DFS from each node, `0` through `n - 1`, inclusive, to determine what the ancestors are for each node. Why does this work? Because the ancestors of a target node are whatever nodes have edges that lead to the target node; hence, executing a DFS from the target node once edges have been inverted gives us all ancestral nodes for the target node.
