```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def build_adj_list(adj_mat):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            n = len(adj_mat)
            for node in range(n):
                for neighbor in range(node + 1, n):
                    if isConnected[node][neighbor] == 1:
                        graph[node].append(neighbor)
                        graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node):
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor)
        
        graph = build_adj_list(isConnected)
        seen = set()
        provinces = 0
        
        for city in range(len(isConnected)):
            if city not in seen:
                provinces += 1
                seen.add(city)
                dfs(city)
                    
        return provinces
```

Cities are nodes, connected cities are provinces (i.e., connected components). The idea here is to explore *all* provinces by starting with each city and seeing how many cities we can explore from that city &#8212; every time we have to start a search again from a new city, we increment the number of overall provinces encountered thus far.
