Equation problems that require being interpreted as graphs are never very intuitive and always require some creativity. The [solution editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/solution/) for this problem is quite good and highlights one slick way of approach this problem with DFS as the underlying mechanism for driving the solution logic.

The key idea is to treat each possible variable (`a` through `z`) as a node and then to use the provided `equations` where `==` is the comparison to essentially label all equal variables in the same way (i.e., it's like we're assigning a number or color to each node in a connected component). Once this has been done, we process all equations where `!=` is the comparison operator &#8212; if the nodes that cannot be equal are in separate components (i.e., they have different labels), then we are fine; if, however, two nodes cannot be equal but they share the same label, then this means they must also be equal to other (a contradiction).
