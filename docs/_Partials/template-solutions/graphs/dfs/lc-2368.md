```python
class Solution:
    def reachableNodes(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], restricted: List[int]) -> int:
        restricted = set(restricted)
        def build_adj_list(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                if node not in restricted and neighbor not in restricted:
                    graph[node].append(neighbor)
                    graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node):
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen and neighbor not in restricted:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor)
            
        graph = build_adj_list(edges)
        seen = {0}
        dfs(0)
        return len(seen)
```

The idea behind the solution above is to *start* by ensuring our graph only has valid nodes. This means getting rid of all edges that contain one (or both) nodes from the `restricted` list, which we start by "setifying" in order to make it possible to have $O(1)$ lookups.

It's worth reflecting on why it behooves us to get rid of an edge when one of its nodes is from the `restricted` set. If the node in the restricted is the source, then there's no way to get to its destination. If the restricted node *is* the destination, then we will not go there from the source. Whatever the case, it is a waste of time and space to consider edges that have one (or both) nodes from the `restricted` set. 

At the end, the number of nodes reached from `0` is the length of the set `seen`, which is why we return `len(seen)`. We could just as well kept track of the number of visited nodes by just using the `dfs` function itself:

```python
class Solution:
    def reachableNodes(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], restricted: List[int]) -> int:
        restricted = set(restricted)
        def build_adj_list(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                if node not in restricted and neighbor not in restricted:
                    graph[node].append(neighbor)
                    graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node):
            ans = 0
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen and neighbor not in restricted:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    ans +=  1 + dfs(neighbor)
                    
            return ans
            
        graph = build_adj_list(edges)
        seen = {0}
        return dfs(0) + 1
