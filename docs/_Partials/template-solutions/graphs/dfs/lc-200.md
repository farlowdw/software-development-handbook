                neighbor = (next_row, next_col)

        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        dirs = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]
        seen = set()
        islands = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                node = (i, j)
                if node not in seen and grid[i][j] == '1':
                    islands += 1
                    seen.add(node)
                    dfs(*node)

```

Each "island" is a connected component &#8212; our job is to count the total number of connected components. The traversal is a fairly standard DFS traversal on a grid-like graph.
