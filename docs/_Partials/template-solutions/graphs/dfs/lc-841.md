```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def dfs(node):
            for neighbor in rooms[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor)
    
        seen = {0}
        dfs(0)
        return len(seen) == len(rooms)
```

It's quite nice that the given input, `rooms`, is already in the form of an adjacency list (as an index array). The key insight is to realize that we can use our `seen` set to determine whether or not all rooms have been visited after conducting a DFS from node `0` (i.e., room `0`); that is, if `seen` is the same length as `rooms` after the DFS from node `0`, then we can say it's possible to visit all rooms (otherwise it's not).
