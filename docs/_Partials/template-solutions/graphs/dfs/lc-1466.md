```python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        roads = set()
        def build_adj_list(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                roads.add((node, neighbor))
                graph[node].append(neighbor)
                graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node):
            ans = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    if (node, neighbor) in roads:
                        ans += 1
                    ans += dfs(neighbor)
            return ans
                
        graph = build_adj_list(connections)
        seen = {0}

This is a *tough* one to come up with if you haven't seen it before. The solution approach above is quite clever. The idea is to build an *undirected* graph in the form of an adjacency list and then to conduct a DFS from node `0`, which means every edge we encounter is necessarily *leading away from `0`*; hence, if that edge appeared in the original road configuration, `roads`, then we know that road's direction must be changed so that it faces *toward* node `0` instead of *away*.
