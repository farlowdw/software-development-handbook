```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n and grid[row][col] == 1
        
        def dfs(row, col):
            connected_area = 0
            
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                next_row, next_col = row + dr, col + dc
                next_node = (next_row, next_col)
                if valid(*next_node) and next_node not in seen:
                    seen.add(next_node)
                    connected_area += 1 + dfs(*next_node)
            
            return connected_area
                
        
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        dirs = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
        seen = set()
        max_area = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i, j) not in seen and grid[i][j] == 1:
                    seen.add((i, j))
                    max_area = max(max_area, 1 + dfs(i, j))
                    
        return max_area
```

The idea here is to basically find the *largest* connected component.
