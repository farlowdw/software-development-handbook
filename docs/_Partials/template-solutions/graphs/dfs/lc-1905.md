```python
class Solution:
    def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n and grid2[row][col] == 1
        
        def dfs(row, col):
            if not valid(row, col):
                return True
            
            grid2[row][col] = 0
            is_subisland = grid1[row][col] == 1
            
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                is_subisland &= dfs(row + dr, col + dc)
            
            return is_subisland
        
        m = len(grid2)
        n = len(grid2[0])
        dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        sub_islands = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid2[i][j] == 1:
                    if dfs(i, j):
                        sub_islands += 1
        
        return sub_islands
```

The approach above is easier to explain if we generously add comments to the code:

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n and grid2[row][col] == 1
        
        def dfs(row, col):
            # early return True if DFS hits out-of-bounds cell or non-island/water cell (0) in grid2
            # Boundary cells: When the DFS reaches the boundary of the island (i.e., a cell outside the
            #   grid or a non-island/water cell), it should not cause the island to be disqualified as a sub-island
            # Island check: The goal is to verify that all 1s in the connected component we're exploring in grid2
            #   correspond to 1s in grid1; the DFS should stop (return True) if it hits water or goes out of bounds
            #   because these conditions do not invalidate the sub-island
            # Summary: Essentially, the "if not valid(row, col): return True" condition ensures the DFS only
            #   continues exploring valid island cells within grid2's bounds and stops when it reaches the edge
            #   of the island or goes out of bounds. Returning True here is the equivalent of saying, "This path
            #   is fine, keep checking the rest of the island."
            if not valid(row, col):
                return True
            
            grid2[row][col] = 0                 # mark cell as visited
            is_subisland = grid1[row][col] == 1 # does the land cell in grid2 correspond to a land cell in grid1?
            
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                is_subisland &= dfs(row + dr, col + dc)
            
            return is_subisland
        
        m = len(grid2)
        n = len(grid2[0])
        dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        sub_islands = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid2[i][j] == 1:     # start exploring an island in grid2
                    if dfs(i, j):        # all land cells in grid2 correspond to land cells in grid1
                        sub_islands += 1 # (out of bounds and non-island/water cells do not invalidate sub-islands)
        
        return sub_islands
```

**Time:** $O(mn)$. Let $m$ and $n$ represent the number of rows and columns, respectively. We iterate over all rows and columns in `grid2`.

**Space:** $O(mn)$. The main space cost is from the recursive call stack.
