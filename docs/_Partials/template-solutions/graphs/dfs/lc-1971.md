```python
class Solution:
    def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
        def build_adj_list(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                graph[node].append(neighbor)
                graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node):
            if node == destination:
                return True
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    if dfs(neighbor):
                        return True
            return False
        
        graph = build_adj_list(edges)
        seen = {source}
        return dfs(source)
```

The solution above is a direct application of a DFS traversal. The hardest part is arguably coming up with an effective way of writing the `dfs` function. It's better not to rely on a nonlocal variable unless we really need to. The idea is that we should stop searching if we encounter a node whose value is equal to the destination. If that is not the case, then we *try* to explore further. If our DFS comes up empty, then we return `False`, and that will propagate back up the recursion chain.
