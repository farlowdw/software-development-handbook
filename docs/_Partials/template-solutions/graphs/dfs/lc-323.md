```python
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def build_adj_list(edge_arr):
            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for node, neighbor in edge_arr:
                graph[node].append(neighbor)
                graph[neighbor].append(node)
            return graph
        
        def dfs(node):
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor)

        graph = build_adj_list(edges)
        seen = set()
        cc = 0
        
        for node in range(n):
            if node not in seen:
                cc += 1
                seen.add(node)
                dfs(node)
        
        return cc
```

Counting the number of connected components in a graph via DFS traversal is a very common task. Sometimes the nature of the connected components may be obfuscated at first (i.e., we have to come up with a way to first model the connections and *then* determine the number of connected components), but that is not the case here.

One thing worth noting in the solution above is how we deftly take care of the case where a node is *not* represented in the original edge list we're provided. We simply increment the count of the number of connected components, `cc`, as soon as we encounter a node we have not seen before, and we do this for all `n` nodes. For nodes that are not connected to any other nodes, are `dfs` function effectively does not execute.
