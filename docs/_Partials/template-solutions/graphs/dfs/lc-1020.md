The solution above could almost certainly be improved, but it captures the core idea for almost any effective solution to this problem &#8212; we need to pre-process to identify all land cells that reside on the boundary. A DFS from each of those cells should be used to identify invalid land cells. There are a few ways of doing this &#8212; we could mutate the input grid by letting our DFS mark all boundary land cells and invalid connected land cells with `0` or some other value. Then we simply need to count the number of cells with `1` in them. The following solution is much more optimized for this kind of approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def numEnclaves(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def valid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n and grid[row][col] == 1
        
        def process_perimeter(mat):
            first_row = 0
            last_row = m - 1
            first_col = 0
            last_col = n - 1
            
            for row in [ first_row, last_row ]:
                for col in range(n):
                    if mat[row][col] == 1:
                        dfs(row, col)
                        
            for col in [ first_col, last_col ]:
                for row in range(1, m - 1):
                    if mat[row][col] == 1:
                        dfs(row, col)
            
        def dfs(row, col):
            grid[row][col] = 0
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                next_row, next_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if valid(next_row, next_col):
                    dfs(next_row, next_col)
            
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        dirs = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]
        process_perimeter(grid)
        enclaves = 0
            
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                enclaves += grid[i][j]
                
        return enclaves
```
