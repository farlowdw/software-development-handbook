```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, firstList: List[List[int]], secondList: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        p1 = p2 = 0
        
        while p1 < len(firstList) and p2 < len(secondList):
            f_start = firstList[p1][0]
            f_end = firstList[p1][1]
            s_start = secondList[p2][0]
            s_end = secondList[p2][1]
            
            # determine if firstList[p1] intersects secondList[p2]
            lo = max(f_start, s_start)
            hi = min(f_end, s_end)
            if lo <= hi:
                res.append([lo, hi])
            
            # remove interval with smallest endpoint
            if f_end < s_end:
                p1 += 1
            else:
                p2 += 1
                
        return res
```

The two pointer approach above is probably the cleanest implementation for this problem. The strategy is deceptively simple: determine whether or not the linked intervals overlap (if so, add the intersection to the results array) and *then* increment past whichever interval has the smallest endpoint.

We do not have to worry about missing any intersected intervals in the last conditional of the `while` loop (i.e., the removal of the interval with the smallest endpoint) because of the condition that the intervals in each list are pairwise disjoint. That is, for whichever while loop iteration we are currently processing, the interval with the smallest endpoint can only intersect a single interval in the other list (otherwise, the other list would have to have overlapping intervals, which violates the pairwise disjoint condition).

Another less polished two pointer solution might be the following, but it just overcomplicates things:

```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, firstList: List[List[int]], secondList: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        p1 = p2 = 0
        
        while p1 < len(firstList) and p2 < len(secondList):
            f_start = firstList[p1][0]
            f_end = firstList[p1][1]
            s_start = secondList[p2][0]
            s_end = secondList[p2][1]
            
            if f_end < s_start:
                p1 += 1
            elif s_end < f_start:
                p2 += 1
            else:
                res.append([max(f_start, s_start), min(f_end, s_end)])
                if f_end > s_end:
                    p2 += 1
                else:
                    p1 += 1
                
        return res
```
