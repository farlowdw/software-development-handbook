```python
def merge_sorted_arrs(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = 0
    res = []
    
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            res.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        elif arr1[i] > arr2[j]:
            res.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
        else:
            res.append(arr1[i])
            res.append(arr2[j])
            i += 1
            j += 1
    
    while i < len(arr1):
        res.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1

    while j < len(arr2):
        res.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1
        
    return res
```

**Time:** $O(n + m)$. The time complexity here is $O(n + m)$, where `n == len(arr1)` and `m == len(arr2)`, because we never make more than $n + m$ iterations. We gradually process *both* arrays completely, and the work done within each while loop along the way is $O(1)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The space complexity here is $O(1)$ because we do not typically include the output we're building towards the space complexity computation itself; nonetheless, one could make the argument the space complexity is also $O(n + m)$ because we end up creating an array that we return with $n + m$ elements.
