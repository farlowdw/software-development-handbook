```python
class Solution:
    def getCommon(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
            if nums1[i] < nums2[j]:
                i += 1
            elif nums2[j] < nums1[i]:
                j += 1
            else:
                return nums1[i]
        return -1
```

The idea here is that we keep advancing one pointer until it overshoots the value referenced by the other pointer. Then we switch pointers and do the same. This will eventually leads us to the first common value or we'll exhaust both inputs and return `-1`, indicating there is no common element, as desired.
