```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def next_valid_char(r, start_pos):
            skip = 0
            for i in range(start_pos, -1, -1):
                if r[i] == '#':
                    skip += 1
                elif skip > 0:
                    skip -= 1
                else:
                    return i
            return -1
            
        s_p = len(s) - 1
        t_p = len(t) - 1

        # still characters to process
        while s_p >= 0 or t_p >= 0:
            s_p = next_valid_char(s, s_p)
            t_p = next_valid_char(t, t_p)
            
            # both strings are fully processed
            if s_p < 0 and t_p < 0:
                return True
            # one string is not fully processed but the other one is
            # OR the current valid characters don't match
            elif (s_p < 0 or t_p < 0) or s[s_p] != t[t_p]:
                return False
            # a match is made for the valid characters so we continue
            else:
                s_p -= 1
                t_p -= 1
            
        return True
```

This is not a typical "exhaust both inputs" two pointer problem. The stack-based solution is somewhat clear from the outset:

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def get_str(r):
            stack = []
            for char in r:
                if char == '#':
                    if stack:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(char)
            return "".join(stack)
        
        s_str = get_str(s)
        t_str = get_str(t)
        return s_str == t_str
```

But this is $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, but as the follow-up for this problem suggests, we can do better on the space, specifically $O(1)$. And we use two pointers to accomplish that.

The key observation is to consider both strings *from their ends*. We only ever want to compare characters we know to be valid for the eventual final string. Iterating from the front is a non-starter since we don't know in advance how many backspace characters `#` we'll encounter. But if we iterate from the back, then we can treat `#` characters as skips and track their count. The `next_valid_char` utility function lets us look at each string to determine what their next valid characters at the end would be, returning the valid character's position or `-1` if no next valid character is available.

We then take the return values from `next_valid_char` and perform some logic to determine whether or not we should keep processing the strings:

- If all we did was skip through the rest of all the characters for both strings, then clearly the strings must be equal.
- If we skipped through everything in one string but still have characters remaining in the other string, then these strings couldn't possibly be equal. Additionally, if we have valid characters from both strings but they're not equal, then again the strings have to be unequal.
- Finally, if both checks above don't flag the processing as completed, then we need to continue on by advancing to the next character.

We can actually generalize the logic in the `next_valid_char` function to handle iterables of any kind where skip conditions are made and we want the rightmost valid element:

```python
def next_valid_element(arr_or_str, start_pos):
    # declare elements for which skips will be made
    one_skip_elements = { '#', '!' }
    two_skip_elements = { '@', '%', '*' }
    three_skip_elements = { '^' }
    
    # always start with 0 skips
    skip = 0
    
    # process entire iterable until valid element is found
    for i in range(start_pos, -1, -1):
        el = arr_or_str[i]
        # one or more skips needed
        if el in one_skip_elements:
            skip += 1
        elif el in two_skip_elements:
            skip += 2
        elif el in three_skip_elements:
            skip += 3
        # valid element found but skips exist
        elif skip > 0:
            skip -= 1
        # valid element found and no skips: return position
        else:
            return i
    
    # no valid element was found
    return -1
```
