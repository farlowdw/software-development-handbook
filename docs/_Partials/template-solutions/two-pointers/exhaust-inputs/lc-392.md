```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # early return (small optimization)
        if len(s) > len(t):
            return False
        
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1
            
        return i == len(s)
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. If `n == len(t)`, then there is a chance we could end up iterating through all of the characters in `t`, but that is the worst-case scenario.

**Space:** $O(1)$. There is only a constant amount of space used to solve this problem.
