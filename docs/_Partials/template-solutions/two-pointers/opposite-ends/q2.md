```python
def check_for_target(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        pair_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if pair_sum > target:    # pair_sum is too large (decrease by decrementing right pointer)
            right -= 1
        elif pair_sum < target:  # pair_sum is too small (increase by incremeneting left pointer)
            left += 1
        else:
            return True           # pair_sum equals target (return True)
        
    return False
```

The important observation here is that the pair sum can only increase by incrementing the `left` pointer while it can only decrease by decrementing the `right` pointer (due to the sorted nature of the input array, `nums`). Additionally worth noting is the need for the *strict* inequality `left < right`; if the inequality were not strict, then we could consider the same unique element twice (i.e., when `left == right`), which is not desired.

**Time:** $O(n)$. The `left` and `right` pointers start a distance $n$ from each other, where $n$ is the length of `nums`, and these pointers work their way towards each other for the duration of the while loop. We cannot have more than $n$ iterations.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Only a constant amount of memory allocation is used.
