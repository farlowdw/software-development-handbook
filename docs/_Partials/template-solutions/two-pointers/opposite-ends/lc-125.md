```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
                left += 1
            while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
                right -= 1

            if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
                return False

            left += 1
            right -= 1

        return True
```

Using an "opposite ends two pointer approach" is fairly clear here &#8212; the main wrinkle comes in handling the non-alphanumeric characters properly. This involves shifting the pointers in such a way that we effectively "skip over" the non-alphanumeric characters. Python's `str.isalnum()` function is quite handy here:

> Return `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. A character `c` is alphanumeric if one of the following returns `True`: `c.isalpha()`, `c.isdecimal()`, `c.isdigit()`, or `c.isnumeric()`.

Most languages have something similar or equivalent. Using `isalnum` effectively here reduces a bunch of otherwise ugly boilerplate code.
