```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        res = []
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            curr = nums[i]
            if curr > 0:
                break
            
            # skip repeated values to avoid duplicate results

                elif curr_pair > target:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    res.append([curr, nums[left], nums[right]])
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1
                    
                    # skip the values we just added to avoid duplicate results
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:
                        left += 1

The two pointers approach for this problem is not obvious, largely because the first step in the two pointers solution is a pre-sorting one (i.e., we sort the array first in order to effectively employ two pointers). Further, we use the "opposite ends" two pointers approach *for each iteration* through the sorted `nums` array. Once a two pointer approach is settled on (there are other approaches), the hardest part of the problem is ensuring duplicate results are not included. How this works exactly is best understood by means of an example input (assume the pre-sorting has been done in advance):

```
nums = [-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
```

Before analyzing what happens with the code, let's first identify the desired output (i.e., distinct triples) for this example input, namely the following:

```
[[-1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
```

How does the solution above work to give us this? Let `l` and `r` denote the `left` and `right` pointers, respectively. And let `A` denote the current `i`-value for the iteration and `B` the end value (third to last). Then we have the following consequences for the first iteration:

```a title="First iteration"
  A                  B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
      l                    r    # -1 + (-1 + 1) < 0; increment l
         l                 r    # -1 + (0 + 1) == 0; triple: [-1, 0, 1]
            l           r       #     increment l, decrement r
               l        r       # increment l (second skip condition)
                  l     r       # increment l (second skip condition)
                     l  r       # -1 + (1 + 1) > 0; decrement r
                    l/r         # while loop does not execute
```

And the second iteration:

```a title="Second iteration"
      A              B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]   # (first skip condition)
```

Note how the first skip condition ensures we do not create duplicates. If we had continued with the second iteration as shown above, then we would have the following (resulting in a duplicated triple):

```a
      A              B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
# highlight-error-next-line
         l                 r  # -1 + (0 + 1) == 0; triple: [-1, 0 ,1]
```

Now for the third iteration:

```a title="Third iteration"
         A           B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
            l              r    # 0 + (0 + 1) > 0; decrement r
            l           r       # 0 + (0 + 1) > 0; decrement r
            l        r          # 0 + (0 + 1) > 0; decrement r
            l     r             # 0 + (0 + 0) == 0; triple: [0, 0, 0]
              l/r               #     increment l, decrement r
                                #     while loop does not execute
```

Fourth iteration:

```a
            A        B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]   # (first skip condition)
```

Fifth iteration:

```a
               A     B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]   # (first skip condition)
```

Sixth iteration:

```a
                  A  B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]   # (first skip condition)
```

Seventh iteration:

```a
                    A/B
[-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]   # (curr > 0 skip condition)
```
