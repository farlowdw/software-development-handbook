```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

Keep swapping characters until `left` is equal to or greater than `right`. Note that for odd-length `s` the middle character is not actually processed and that's okay since *all other* characters have been swapped.

The solution above takes advantage of Python's tuple unpacking/simultaneous assignment, but a more conventional approach where we rely on a `temp` variable would be as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            temp = s[right]
            s[right] = s[left]
            s[left] = temp
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Both solutions above are $O(n)$ for time, where `n = len(s)`. The solution is "really" more like $O(n/2) = O(n)$ since we move one unit closer to the middle from both sides for each iteration of the while loop. We cannot have more than $n$ iterations.

**Space:** $O(1)$. A constant amount of space is used for both solutions above.
