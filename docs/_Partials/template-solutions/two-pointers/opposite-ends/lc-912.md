The [official solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/solution/) provides illustrative implementations of the following sorting algorithms: merge sort, heap sort, counting sort, and radix sort. The sort above, quick sort, is really meant to illustrate how a well-known and often used sorting algorithm (qucksort) fundamentally uses a two pointer strategy behind the scenes for one of its most efficient implementations (i.e., the in-place manipulation of its elements). The `partition` method of the code block above serves to highlight where the two pointer strategy is being used. 

This strategy is effectively the same as that used in <LC id='75' type='long' ></LC>. The discussion below details the differences more clearly.

How is the `partition` method of in-place quicksort (left) similar to the Dutch flag problem solution (right)? They're very similar! Almost the same. For the Dutch flag problem, the values `0`, `1`, and `2` represented `RED`, `WHITE`, and `BLUE`, respectively. For in-place quicksort, values smaller than the pivot represent `RED`, values equal to the pivot represent `WHITE`, and values greater than the pivot represent `BLUE`. 

We still fundamentally start with the following overall situation:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='375px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/two-pointers/f2.png').default} />
</div>

The difference for this sorting problem that makes it somewhat more complicated than the Dutch flag problem is that we recursively solve smaller and smaller instances of the same subproblem (as opposed to sorting all values in a single pass). 

For example, suppose `nums = [3,7,4,10,8,1,3,4,3,2]` is our original array and that the random pivot we get is the index value of `6`, meaning `nums[6] = 3` serves as our pivot. Then the initial `partition` method will result in something similar to the following array of numbers (i.e., where all numbers have been partitioned in such a way that every number less than the pivot lies to the left while every number greater than the pivot lies to the right):

```
[2,1,3,3,3,8,4,10,4,7]
```

The genius of quicksort is that each value of `3`, after the first partition, is where it should *permanently belong* for the final sorted array. Our original problem of sorting `nums = [3,7,4,10,8,1,3,4,3,2]` has now been reduced to the following smaller instances of the same problem:

```python
[3,7,4,10,8,1,3,4,3,2]    # initial array; pivot -> nums[6] = 3
[2,1,3,3,3,8,4,10,4,7]    # result after first partition
[2,1]     [8,4,10,4,7]    # subproblems to be solved
```
