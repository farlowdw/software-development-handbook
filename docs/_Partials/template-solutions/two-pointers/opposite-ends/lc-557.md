```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        def reverseWord(start, end):
            while start < end:
                res[start], res[end] = res[end], res[start]
                start += 1
                end -= 1
        
        n = len(s)
        res = list(s)
        word_start = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == ' ':
                reverseWord(word_start, i - 1)
                word_start = i + 1
        
        reverseWord(word_start, n - 1)
            
        return ''.join(res)
```

The directive is simple: reverse each space-separated block of characters (i.e., "word") while leaving the spaces in place. But implementing a solution is perhaps a little trickier than it seems at first.

We can use two pointers on opposite ends for each block of characters, but we need some way of determining where the beginning of each word occurs. The first word will naturally start at index `0` and each subsequent word will start at whatever character occurs first after a space. The end of a word will aways be whatever character was most recently encountered *before* a space.
