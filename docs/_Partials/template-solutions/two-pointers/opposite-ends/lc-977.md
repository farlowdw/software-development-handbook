        right = insert = len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if abs(nums[left]) < abs(nums[right]):
                res[insert] = nums[right] ** 2
                right -= 1
            else:
                res[insert] = nums[left] ** 2

```

This is a clever application of the two pointer approach. `nums` being sorted means it has some negative elements with squares in decreasing order and some non-negative elements with squares in increasing order. The numbers with the largest magnitude (and hence largest square value) will be on *opposite ends* of the input array.

The strategy is to first initialize a results array, `res`, that is the same size as `nums` and then fill it in with the squares from right to left. This makes it possible for us to use two pointers in such a way that we're always moving towards numbers with smaller magnitudes (and hence smaller squares) while filling in the results array from largest squares to least squares so that `res` is also sorted, as required.

Also worth noting is the need for the *non-strict* inequality `left <= right` because if `nums` has an odd length and the middle number is negative, then we still need to use its square.

**Time:** $O(n)$. We process *all* elements in the array, meaning the time is $O(n)$ where `n == len(nums)`.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Or $O(n)$ if we consider the output to contribute to the space complexity (many people do not count that).

<ChipDivider>Using a for loop instead</ChipDivider>

An arguably more intuitive approach, yet equivalent in terms of time and space complexity, may be obtained by using a simple for loop:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [-1] * n
        
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            left_squared = nums[left] ** 2
            right_squared = nums[right] ** 2
            
            if right_squared > left_squared:
                res[i] = right_squared
                right -= 1
            else:
                res[i] = left_squared
                left += 1
                
        return res
```
