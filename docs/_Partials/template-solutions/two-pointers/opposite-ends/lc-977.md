```python
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [0] * n
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if abs(nums[left]) < abs(nums[right]):
                square = nums[right]
                right -= 1
            else:
                square = nums[left]
                left += 1
            res[i] = square * square
        return res
```

This is a clever application of the two pointer approach. `nums` being sorted means it has some negative elements with squares in decreasing order and some non-negative elements with squares in increasing order. The numbers with the largest magnitude (and hence largest square value) will be on *opposite ends* of the input array.

The strategy is to first initialize a results array, `res`, that is the same size as `nums` and then fill it in with the squares from right to left. This makes it possible for us to use two pointers in such a way that we're always moving towards numbers with smaller magnitudes (and hence smaller squares) while filling in the results array from largest squares to least squares so that `res` is also sorted, as required.
