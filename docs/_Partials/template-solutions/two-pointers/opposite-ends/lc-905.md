```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            if nums[left] % 2 == 0:
                left += 1
            elif nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                right -= 1
            else:
                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
        return nums
```

The idea is to skip left-pointed even numbers (since they're already where they're supposed to be) and skip right-pointed odd numbers (since they're also where they're supposed to be). If we do not perform either skip, then this means *both* numbers are not where they're supposed to be and we should *swap* them.

The essence of this problem is the same as that of the *Polish National Flag Problem*, which is artfully stated in the following manner in <BibRef id='AL2011_Puzzles' pages='p. 23'></BibRef>:

> There is a row of $n > 1$ checkers on the table, some of them are red and some are white. (Red and white are the colors of the Polish national flag.) Design an algorithm to rearrange the checkers so that all the red checkers precede all the white ones. The only operations allowed are the examination of a checker's color and the swapping of two checkers. Try to minimize the number of swaps made by your algorithm.

The fundamental idea behind the solution to this problem is a two pointer one in disguise: Find the leftmost white checker and the rightmost red checker &#8212; if the leftmost white checker is to the right of the rightmost red checker, then the problem is solved; otherwise, swap the two and repeat the operation. 

Here's an illustration of this algorithm in action:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='450px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/two-pointers/f1.png').default} />
</div>

Of course, in the context of *implementing* the algorithm with code, we need some way of automating the finding of the leftmost white checker and the rightmost red checker &#8212; we do that using two pointers. The solution above can be slightly modified to more closely align with the verbiage of the Polish National Flag Problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        # RED is 0 to denote even numbers (zero remainder when divided by 2)
        # WHITE is 1 to denote odd numbers (remainder of 1 when divided by 2)
        RED = 0
        WHITE = 1
        
        while left <= right:
            # stop pointing at red checkers until leftmost white checker is encountered
            if nums[left] % 2 == RED:
                left += 1
            # stop pointing at white checkers until rightmost red checker is encountered
            elif nums[right] % 2 == WHITE:
                right -= 1
            # swap the misplaced white (left pointed) and red checkers (right pointed)
            else:
                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
        return nums
```
