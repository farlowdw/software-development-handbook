```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            if nums[left] % 2 == 0:
                left += 1
            elif nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                right -= 1
            else:
                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
        return nums
```

The idea is to skip left-pointed even numbers (since they're already where they're supposed to be) and skip right-pointed odd numbers (since they're also where they're supposed to be). If we do not perform either skip, then this means *both* numbers are not where they're supposed to be and we should *swap* them.
