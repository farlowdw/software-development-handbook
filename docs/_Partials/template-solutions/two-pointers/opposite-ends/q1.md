```python
def check_if_palindrome(s):
    left = 0
    right = len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        
        left += 1
        right -= 1
        
    return True
```

Note that for odd-length `s` the middle character is not actually processed and that's okay.

**Time:** $O(n)$. This algorithm is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string `s`. We cannot make more iterations than the length of `s` since we either return `false` or increment and decrement at the same time. In actuality, the time is closer to $O(n/2)=O(n)$.

**Space:** $O(1)$. A *constant* amount of memory is allocated.
