```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    left = 0
    right = len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        
        left += 1
        right -= 1
        
    return True
```

Note that for odd-length `s` the middle character is not actually processed and that's okay.
