This problem, which may be considered a more advanced version of <LC id='905' type='long' ></LC> (i.e., the *Polish National Flag Problem* due to the Polish flag having colors red and white), is known as the *Dutch National Flag Problem* (due to the Dutch flag having colors red, white, and blue). 

A wonderful framing for this problem appears in <BibRef id='AL2011_Puzzles' pages='p. 63'></BibRef> (the algorithm's verbal solution also follows from this resource):

> There is a row of $n$ checkers of three colors: red, white, and blue. Devise an algorithm to rearrange the checkers so that all the red checkers come first, all the white ones come next, and all the blue checkers come last. The only operations allowed are examination of a checker's color and swap of two checkers. Try to minimize the number of swaps made by your algorithm.

The "swap of two checkers" phrase may indicate a two pointers approach could be appropriate. The following algorithm, which can be used with some creativity when implementing the [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) sorting algorithm, is based on considering the checker row as made up of four contiguous possibly empty sections: red checkers on the left, then white checkers, then the checkers whose colors are yet to be identified, and finally blue checkers:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='375px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/two-pointers/f2.png').default} />
</div>

Initially, the red, white, and blue sections are empty, with all the checkers being in the unknown section. On each iteration, the algorithm shrinks the size of the unknown section by one element either from the left or from the right: If the first (i.e., leftmost) checker in the unknown section is red, swap it with the first checker after the red section and advance to the next checker; if it is white, advance to the next checker; if it is blue, swap it with the last checker before the blue section. This step is repeated as long as there are checkers in the unknown section.

  <img width='600px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/two-pointers/f3.png').default} />
</div>

As with <LC id='905' type='long' ></LC>, however, to actually *implement* the algorithm illustrated above with code means we're going to need some pointers to keep track of things. The use of *two* pointers in <LC id='905' type='' ></LC> was somewhat straightforward:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        # RED is 0 to denote even numbers (zero remainder when divided by 2)
        # WHITE is 1 to denote odd numbers (remainder of 1 when divided by 2)
        RED = 0
        WHITE = 1
        
        while left <= right:
            # stop pointing at red checkers until leftmost white checker is encountered
            if nums[left] % 2 == RED:
                left += 1
            # stop pointing at white checkers until rightmost red checker is encountered
            elif nums[right] % 2 == WHITE:
                right -= 1
            # swap the misplaced white (left pointed) and red checkers (right pointed)
            else:
                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
        return nums
```

We will still use *two* pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the left and right boundaries of the "unknown" zone, pictured previously. But the following part of our algorithm necessitates the addition of another kind of pointer: "If the leftmost checker in the unknown section is red, then swap it with the first checker after the red section (i.e., the first or leftmost white checker) and advance to the next checker." So we basically need three pointers: two for the "unknown" zone (`left` and `right`), which shrinks inward as we process checkers, and one for where the first white checker is or *should* be (`first_white_pos`).

As long as a white checker is present, the final value of `first_white_pos` will always point to where the first white checker is. If we print the final `nums` array as well as the final `first_white_pos` value, then we'll have the following:

```a
[2,0,2,1,1,0]   # initial colors array
[0,0,1,1,2,2]   # sorted colors array
2               # first_white_pos final value
```

If, however, a white checker is *not* present, then `first_white_pos`, will point to where the first white checker *should* be if one were added:

```a
[2,0,2,0,0,0]   # initial colors array
[0,0,0,0,2,2]   # sorted colors array
4               # first_white_pos final value
```
