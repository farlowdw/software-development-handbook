```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        slow = fast = 0
        
        while fast < len(nums):
            if nums[fast] != val:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
            
        return slow
```

The two pointer solution here is arguably a bit of a mind-bender at first, but it becomes quite clear after some reflection. The basic idea: move the `slow` pointer continuously *until* it hits the first `val` that needs to be removed. Then, whenever the `fast` pointer encounters an element not equal to `val`, swap the elements that `slow` and `fast` point to (`val` and non-`val` elements, respectively). Wherever `slow` ends up pointing (in terms of index value) is the final length of the array whose elements have not been removed.

To see the logic unfold, try moving along the `i` and `j` pointers below (representing the `slow` and `fast` pointers, respectively) and swapping values as the solution logic requires:

```
val = 2

[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]
 i
 j
```

For example, `i` and `j` move together until the first `2` is reached:

```
[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]
     i
     j
```

And *then* `j` continues forward until the `3` is encountered:

```
[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]
     i
         j
```

At this point, we swap the elements that `i` and `j` point to and then increment `i`:

```
[0,1,3,2,2,0,4,2]
       i
         j
```

And we continue along until the input array `nums` has been exhausted by `j`. Where `i` last points in terms of index value will be the length of the array without `val` present.

Given the structure of this problem, it's common to see a solution also represented as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != val:
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1
                
        return i
```
