```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # not possible for s to be a subsequence of t (micro-optimization)
        if len(s) > len(t):
            return False
        
        # s must be a subsequence of t if s is empty
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
        
        slow = fast = 0
        while fast < len(t):
            if s[slow] == t[fast]:
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
            
            if slow == len(s):
                return True
            
        return False
```

Note that the condition `if len(s) == 0: return True` is not just a micro-optimization in the solution above since we `return False` at the end (due to always checking for an early return with `if slow == len(s): return True`).

**Time:** $O(n)$. If `n == len(t)`, then there is a chance we could end up iterating through all of the characters in `t`, but that is the worst-case scenario.

**Space:** $O(1)$. There is only a constant amount of space used to solve this problem.
