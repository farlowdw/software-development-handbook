```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        slow = fast = 0
        
        while fast < len(nums):
            if nums[fast] != 0:
                nums[slow], nums[fast] = nums[fast], nums[slow]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
```

The idea is for the `slow` pointer to always point to a `0` value and to wait until the `fast` pointer encounters a non-`0` value so that a swap can be made (and then `slow` incremented). For example, we could have a start like the following (`i` and `j` represent the `slow` and `fast` pointers, respectively):

```
[1,0,0,3,12]
 i
 j
```

The first value is not `0` so a vacuous swap occurs and both pointers are incremented:

```
[1,0,0,3,12]
   i
   j
```

Then `j` is incremented again to `0`. Then again to `3`, which is where a swap will need to occur:

```
[1,0,0,3,12]
   i
       j
```

Once the swap occurs and `i` is incremented, we have the following:

```
[1,3,0,0,12]
     i
       j
```

It should be clear now how the relative ordering is respected, all while pushing the `0` values to the end of the array.
