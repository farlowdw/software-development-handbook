```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = 1
        
        while fast < len(nums):
            if nums[fast] != nums[fast-1]:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
            
        return slow 
```

The first number *cannot* be a duplicate; hence, we start both pointers at index `1`. The idea, then, is that we progressively overwrite the contents of `nums` using the `slow` pointer once a yet-unencountered number is reached (we're gauranteed to encounter only new numbers since the input array is sorted).

Given how this specific problem is set up, the following solution may be considered slightly cleaner than the one above:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = 1
        for fast in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[fast] != nums[fast-1]:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
        return slow
```
