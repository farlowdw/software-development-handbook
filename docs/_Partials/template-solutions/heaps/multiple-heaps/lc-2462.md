This is a deceptively difficult problem at first. If the number of candidates on both ends of `costs` ends up overlapping (i.e., `2 * m >= n` in the solution above), then we can treat this problem as a basic heap problem where we find the minimum total cost by using a max heap and ejecting the most costly workers as we encounter them (keeping the `k` cheapest workers on the heap).

The real difficulty lies in what to do when there is no overlap and we need to somehow keep track of how we process workers. As [the official solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/solution/) notes, two heaps can be used to solve this problem (Approach 1), but we can just as easily solve the problem using a single heap if we introduce an effective way of determining which "side" or "partition" of `costs` a worker's cost just came from when we are processing the costs of all workers. *That* side will be the side we need to add a new worker to.

We consider the initial `m` workers (i.e., `m == len(candidates)`) on the left side of `costs` to be in the `HEAD` partititon and the initial `m` workers on the right side of `costs` to be in the `TAIL` partition. For each of `k` iterations, we extract the cost of the cheapest worker and remove that worker from their partition and, so long as new workers remain to be processed, we add a new worker back to that partition. Using a heap in this way allows us to keep the partitions balanced so long as there isn't overlap &#8212; when there is overlap, there's no need to distinguish between the head and tail partitions and we can just remove the minimal cost worker.
