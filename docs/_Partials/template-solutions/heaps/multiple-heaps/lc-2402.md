```python
class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # unused_rooms and used_rooms are both min heaps
        unused_rooms = list(range(n))
        used_rooms = []
        room_meetings = [0] * n
        most_meetings = [0, 0]
        
        meetings.sort()
        for start, end in meetings:
            # maintenance: remove each used room whose end time occurred
            #   before (or at the same time as) the current meeting's start time;
            #   push the now removed used room to the available unused rooms
            while used_rooms and used_rooms[0][0] <= start:
                _, room = heapq.heappop(used_rooms)
                heapq.heappush(unused_rooms, room)
            
            # if an unused room is available, take the smallest numbered one
            if unused_rooms:
                room = heapq.heappop(unused_rooms)      # note room number and remove from unused rooms
                heapq.heappush(used_rooms, (end, room)) # push room to used rooms and note when room will next become available
            else:
                curr_meeting_duration = end - start # time to add to the next available time for the room we will use for the current meeting
                next_available_room_time, room = heapq.heappop(used_rooms) # note the availability time and room number of next available room
                heapq.heappush(used_rooms, (next_available_room_time + curr_meeting_duration, room)) # mark the next available room appropriately
            room_meetings[room] += 1
            
            # keep track of room with the most meetings thus far
            if room_meetings[room] >= most_meetings[0]:
                if room_meetings[room] > most_meetings[0]:
                    most_meetings[0] = room_meetings[room]
                    most_meetings[1] = room
                else:
                    most_meetings[1] = min(most_meetings[1], room)
                    
        return most_meetings[1]
```

This is quite a tough problem at first, but once the idea becomes clear how to use two heaps to effectively manage the used and unused rooms, everything falls neatly into place. The code comments nicely explain the intuition for the solution above.
