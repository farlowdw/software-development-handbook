```python
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.min_heap = []
        self.max_heap = []
        self.length = 0

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, num)
        heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, -heapq.heappop(self.min_heap))
        if len(self.max_heap) - len(self.min_heap) > 1:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, -heapq.heappop(self.max_heap))
        self.length += 1

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        return -self.max_heap[0] if self.length % 2 == 1 else (self.min_heap[0] - self.max_heap[0]) * 0.5
```

The idea above is to use two heaps, a `min_heap` and a `max_heap`, to effectively partition the data stream into "lower" and "upper" halves in terms of numeric values (since a median always depends on a sorted list of numbers). The max heap will contain the lower half (root value in the max heap will be the maximum number for the lower half, meaning it resides towards the middle of the data stream), and the min heap will contain the upper half (root value in the min heap will be the minimum number for the upper half, meaning it resides towards the middle of the data stream). 

Arbitrarily, the solution above is structured in such a way that the root of the max heap will be used if the overall length of the stream is odd. If the stream length is even, then the average of the roots for the heaps will need to be taken.
