This is definitely a tough one, a problem similar to <LC id='295' type='long' ></LC> but with an added degree of difficulty: now we need to *remove* elements from the heaps we're maintaining to dynamically calculate the median for each window.

The strategy is essentially as follows:

- The *parity* of `k` (i.e., odd or even) will determine how median items are calculated (i.e., if `k` is odd, then we'll automatically pull from `max_heap` since `max_heap` is what we've chosen to possibly be the heap with at most a larger size of 1 for valid elements)
- Start by indiscriminately pushing `k` elements to `max_heap`. Then pop half of those elements from `max_heap` and push them to `min_heap`. This ensures the heaps start off as balanced as possible, and the first window of `k` valid elements has been prepared. We append its median to the medians array we will ultimately return.
- For each remaining number in the `nums` input array:
  + Declare each newly encountered number as `in_num`, the newest valid number in a window.
  + Keep track of the newly invalidated number `out_num` that is no longer part of the window (increment the count of `out_num` in the `invalids` lookup dictionary).
  + Let `balance` denote how removing `out_num` will effect the balance of the two heaps: if `out_num` will be removed from `max_heap` (i.e., `out_num` is less than or equal to the root of the max heap), then set `balance = -1`; if, however, `out_num` will be removed from `min_heap`, then set `balance = 1`. The value assigned to `balance` here will effect whether or not we need to re-balance the heaps after `in_num` is added to one of the heaps.
  + Which heap should `in_num` be added to? If `in_num` is less than or equal to `-max_heap[0]`, then `in_num` should be added to `max_heap`, which means `balance` should be incremented by `1`; otherwise, `in_num` should be added to `min_heap`, and `balance` should be decremented by `1`.
  + We've now virtually removed `out_num` from the window and adjusted `balance` accordingly. We've also literally added `in_num` to one of the heaps and also adjusted `balance` accordingly. If `balance == 0`, then the heaps are balanced and we can proceed (`max_heap` may have one more valid element than `min_heap` at this stage, but that is by design). If, however, `balance < 0`, then this means `max_heap` has more valid elements than it should, and the heaps are not balanced &#8212; an element needs to be moved from `max_heap` to `min_heap`. Similar logic applies to needing to move an element from `min_heap` to `max_heap` when `balance > 0`.
  + After the re-balancing done above, it's possible invalid elements now reside at the top of either heap (or both). We need to remove the invalid elements from the heap tops. Note that *order matters here* based on how the rest of the solution is constructed. We need to first remove invalid elements from `max_heap`. Why? Consider the following example input: `nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 2`. How could this be problematic if we removed invalid elements from `min_heap` first instead of `max_heap`? Because the heaps will start out properly balanced with `1` in both heaps. Then, as the window slides to the right, the leftmost `1` becomes invalidated, but our solution doesn't track indexing; hence, when we attempt to remove an invalid `1`, and we do so from `min_heap`, we basically end up with an empty `min_heap` and a `max_heap` with two elements. Since `k == 2` is even, trying to compute the median from the root elements of `min_heap` and `max_heap` leads to an error (`min_heap` is empty). First removing from `max_heap` avoids this, and it makes even more sense when we consider that we're always first trying to add to `max_heap`.
  + The new window has now been prepared, where heap tops are valid elements. We calculate the median and add it to our list.
