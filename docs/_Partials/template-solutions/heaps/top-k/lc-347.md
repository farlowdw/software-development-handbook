```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        freqs = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            freqs[num] += 1
            
        min_heap = []
        for num, freq in freqs.items():
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (freq, num))
            if len(min_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                
        return [ pair[1] for pair in min_heap ]
```

Since we are trying to find the `k` elements that occur with *maximal* frequency, we should use a *min heap* so that we regularly remove the "worst" element (i.e., least frequently occurring element). Pre-processing steps like finding each element's frequency is fairly common in problems whose solutions rely on heaps in some way.
