```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        min_heap = []
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
            if len(min_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        return min_heap[0]
```

This is kind of a classic, simplified heap application. We limit the heap to be of size `k`, and we use a min heap to gradually remove smaller elements. Once we've processed the entire array, the element at the root of the min heap is the `k`th largest element (the heap holds the `k` largest elements and the min heap gives us access to the smallest one, which is the `k`th largest).
