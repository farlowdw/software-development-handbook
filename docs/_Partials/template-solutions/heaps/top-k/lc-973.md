```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def distance_from_origin(x, y):
            dist = (x * x + y * y) ** 0.5
            return (-dist, x, y)
        
        max_heap = []
        for point in points:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, distance_from_origin(*point))
            if len(max_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                
        return [ [pair[1], pair[2]] for pair in max_heap ]
```

This is a great heap problem. The origin is `(0,0)`; hence, we simply need to find the distance from each point in `points` to the origin and use a max heap to keep track of the distances, popping the "worst" (i.e., farthest away) point whenever the size of the heap exceeds `k`.
