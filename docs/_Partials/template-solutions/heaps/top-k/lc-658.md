```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        max_heap = []
        for num in arr:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-abs(num - x), -num))
            if len(max_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                
        return sorted(-pair[1] for pair in max_heap)
```

This is one of those problems that *can* be solved with a heap, but that does not mean a heap is necessarily the best option (in fact, this almost certainly cannot be the best option for this problem since we do not use the fact that the input array is already sorted). Regardless, the heap solution above can be informative because it makes us think through how tuples should be pushed to the heap (the distance is the first criterion for the priority, but the magnitude of the number is the second criterion).
