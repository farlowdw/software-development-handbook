```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.min_heap = []
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, num)
            if len(self.min_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        if len(self.min_heap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
        return self.min_heap[0]
```

Arguably the hardest part of this problem lies in fully understanding the problem statement. It's poorly expressed. Essentially, we're given `k` as well as the data stream of numbers, `nums`, as it exists *so far*. Then we incrementally add numbers to the stream where we report the `k`th largest in the stream as we go. We can use a heap here even though it's a little unnatural because we end up ejecting elements from the heap as we go along.
