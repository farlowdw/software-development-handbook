        m = len(nums1)
        n = len(nums2)

            if j + 1 < n:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i] + nums2[j + 1], i, j + 1))
            # only add tuple below current tuple if current tuple resides in first column
            # (i.e., advance 1 row down if current tuple lies on first column)
            if j == 0 and i + 1 < m:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i + 1] + nums2[j], i + 1, j))

It's incredibly helpful/useful to look at the provided data as a grid graph where we solve the problem by sort of treating it as a BFS with the help of a min heap:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='800px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/heaps/f1.png').default} />
</div>

- The illustration above provides an example for the input `nums1 = [2, 5, 8]`, `nums2 = [1, 3, 7, 9]`.
- The green numbers are from the input arrays themselves while the blue numbers indicate index values &#8212; the blue tuples show the index values from each input array.
- The grid is constructed in such a way that it's as if we have an `m x n` matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns (i.e., the number of rows is the same as the number of elements in `nums1` and the number of columns is the same as the number of elements in `nums2`).
- The magenta numbers above each tuple show the pair sum for that tuple.
- Suppose a tuple is popped from the heap and processed (e.g., the very first tuple at coordinates `(0,0)`). The orange arrows show which tuples are added to the heap after processing the current tuple. Since both input arrays are sorted, note that it only ever makes sense to add tuples *to the right* of each processed tuple *unless* the tuple processed is in the first column. This also makes it easy for us to avoid having to keep track of potentially considering duplicate tuples.
