```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [ -val for val in stones ]
        heapq.heapify(stones)
        
        while len(stones) > 1:
            y = -heapq.heappop(stones)
            x = -heapq.heappop(stones)
            
            if x == y:
                continue
            else:
                y = y - x
                heapq.heappush(stones, -y)
                
        return -stones[0] if stones else 0
```

Start by heapifying `stones` into a max heap. Then process the heap in such a way that the rules of the game are respected.
