```python
class SmallestInfiniteSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.added_back = []
        self.removed = set()
        self.curr_smallest = 1

    def popSmallest(self) -> int:
        if self.added_back:
            remove_again = heapq.heappop(self.added_back)
            self.removed.add(remove_again)
            return remove_again
        else:
            smallest = self.curr_smallest
            self.removed.add(smallest)
            self.curr_smallest += 1
            return smallest

    def addBack(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num in self.removed and num < self.curr_smallest:
            self.removed.remove(num)
            heapq.heappush(self.added_back, num)
```

The intended solution, as provided above, is not the easiest to come up with at first. It would be *much* easier if we simply exploited the problem constraint of `1 <= num <= 1000`:

```python
class SmallestInfiniteSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.min_heap = [ num for num in range(1, 1000 + 1)]
        self.removed = set()

    def popSmallest(self) -> int:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
        self.removed.add(smallest)
        return smallest

    def addBack(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num in self.removed:
            self.removed.remove(num)
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, num)
```

But this is cheating and doesn't really apply at scale. We should be able to come up with a solution that doesn't depend on initializing our min heap in such a way. We can still use some of the logic in the "cheat solution" above in the intended solution. The intended solution basically uses the following logic:

- Maintain `self.curr_smallest`, which will always be a pointer to what the *newest* smallest number in the infinite set could be.
- If numbers get added back that are smaller than `self.curr_smallest`, then we need some way of being able to manage these numbers in such a way that we always have access to the smallest one. We use a min heap for that: `self.added_back`. Of course, numbers should only ever be added back if, in fact, they were once removed *and* they are smaller than `self.curr_smallest`. We use the set `self.removed` to track the status of which elements have, in fact, been removed.
