```python
class SeatManager:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.available = [ i for i in range(1, n + 1) ]

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        return heapq.heappop(self.available)

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.available, seatNumber)
```

This is an easy problem to over-complicate. It's tempting to craft a solution where we're actively tracking the available *and* unavailable seats:

```python
class SeatManager:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.available = [ i for i in range(1, n + 1) ]
        self.unavailable = set()

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        while self.available[0] in self.unavailable:
            heapq.heappop(self.available)
        seat_number = heapq.heappop(self.available)
        self.unavailable.add(seat_number)
        return seat_number

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        self.unavailable.remove(seatNumber)
        heapq.heappush(self.available, seatNumber)
```

But this is really a waste of time *and* space. The reality is that if we *start* with a min heap that represents all available seats, then every time we reserve a seat, that seat simply gets popped from the min heap and is no longer an available seat. When we unreserve a seat, that simply means we add the seat back to the heap. The takeaway: there's no need to explicitly track unavailable seats.
