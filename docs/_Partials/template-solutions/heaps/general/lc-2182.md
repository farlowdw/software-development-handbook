This is a tough problem primarily because of the fancy footwork required to manage how letters are used as well as "next largest letters". It's somewhat clear from the problem statement that we should use a max heap to keep track of the lexicographically largest letters (which we can simulate in Python by negating the character code for each character) as well as the frequency of each letter.

Then we start processing all letters on the heap. The current letter being processed is *always* the lexicographically largest letter remaining. Our job is to ensure we use all occurrences of this letter or return early if we can proceed no longer. We keep track of the repeat count so far and, whenever that limit is reached and occurrences still remain, we check to see if anything else is on the heap to use as a reference for the next largest letter. If not, we're done and we return early because we can't add another letter occurrence without violating the repeat limit. If so, then we essentially "steal" a single occurrence of the next largest letter, adding that to the result string, and reset the repeat count to zero for the current letter being processed.

The mechanics for this problem are largely what makes it difficult.
