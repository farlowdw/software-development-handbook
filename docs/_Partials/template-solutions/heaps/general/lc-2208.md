```python
class Solution:
    def halveArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        arr_sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            arr_sum += nums[i]
            nums[i] = -nums[i]
        
        target = arr_sum * 0.5
        heapq.heapify(nums)
        ops = 0
        
        while arr_sum > target:
            reduced = heapq.heappop(nums) * 0.5
            arr_sum += reduced
            ops += 1
            heapq.heappush(nums, reduced)
            
        return ops
```

The idea here is to first get the entire sum of `nums` and then to heapify `nums` into a max heap. Then we can follow the guidelines outlined in the problem statement.
