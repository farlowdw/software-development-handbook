```python
class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def visit(node, max_path_val, min_path_val, max_diff_so_far):
            if not node:
                return max_path_val - min_path_val
            
            max_path_val = max(max_path_val, node.val)
            min_path_val = min(min_path_val, node.val)
            left = visit(node.left, max_path_val, min_path_val, max_diff_so_far)
            right = visit(node.right, max_path_val, min_path_val, max_diff_so_far)
            
            return max(left, right)
        
        return visit(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'))
```

We're guaranteed at least two nodes which means we don't have to worry about edge cases as much. Our goal is basically to keep track of each path's maximum value as well as its minimum value because the maximum difference will be obtained by subtracting the minimum node value from the maximum node value.
