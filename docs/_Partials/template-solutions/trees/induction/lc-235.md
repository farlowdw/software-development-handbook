```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        parent_val = root.val
        p_val = p.val
        q_val = q.val
        
        # both p and q are greater than parent (LCA must be in right subtree of parent)
        if p_val > parent_val and q_val > parent_val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        # both p and q are less than parent (LCA must be in left subtree of parent)
        elif p_val < parent_val and q_val < parent_val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        # the current root must be the LCA because it is the split point
        else:
            return root
```

If we're familiar with the Lowest Common Ancestor problem, then it may seem like the tree being a BST will complicate things. But, in fact, the tree being a BST drastically simplifies the solution, as can be seen above. The following solution is the solution to the standard problem where the tree is not guaranteed to be a BST:

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        return left if left else right
```

And with comments:

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # non-existent node cannot be LCA
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # current node is p or q -- return it because it could be the LCA (pre-order at this point)
        # stop searching further down this branch because the LCA cannot be deeper
        # any lower node along this branch would not be an ancestor to both p and q
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # all child nodes of current node have been visited (post-order at this point)
        # left/right will only hold non-null values if p or q (or both) were encountered
        #   (as children of the current node)
        # if left AND right are non-null, then LCA must be current node
        #   (it serves as the connector between the two subtrees containing p and q)
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        # both target nodes were not found in the current node's subtrees
        # either one target was found (return that node) or no target was found
        # (arbitrarily return right which will equal None)
        return left if left else right
