```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        if not root.left:
            return 1 + self.minDepth(root.right)
        elif not root.right:
            return 1 + self.minDepth(root.left)
        
        return 1 + min(self.minDepth(root.left), self.minDepth(root.right))
```

The inductive approach for this problem is not the easiest to come up with at first. The idea is that if the current node is missing its left child, then we should explore the right branch. If the current node is missing its right child, then we should explore the left branch. If neither child nodes are missing, then we should explore both branches. Whatever the case, the branch(es) we go down should have `1` added to it to account for the current node's depth.

The "traverse and accumulate" approach is easier to come up with but a bit of a cheat:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        min_leaf_depth = float('inf')
        def visit(node, curr_depth):
            if not node and curr_depth > min_leaf_depth:
                return
            
            curr_depth += 1
            
            nonlocal min_leaf_depth
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                min_leaf_depth = min(min_leaf_depth, curr_depth)
                
            visit(node.left, curr_depth)
            visit(node.right, curr_depth)
            
        visit(root, 0)
        return min_leaf_depth
```
