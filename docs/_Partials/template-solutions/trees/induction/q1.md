```python
def num_leaves(root):
    if not root: 
        return 0
    
    if not root.left and not root.right: 
        return 1

    return num_leaves(root.left) + num_leaves(root.right)
```

A non-existent node should not count anything towards the overall number of leaf nodes. Return `0` for non-existent nodes. If we encounter a leaf node, then we will return `1` in order to include that number in the overall aggregated result.
