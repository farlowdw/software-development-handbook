```python
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        def visit(node, sum_so_far):
            if not node:
                return False
            
            sum_so_far += node.val
            
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return sum_so_far == targetSum
            
            return visit(node.left, sum_so_far) or visit(node.right, sum_so_far)
        
        return visit(root, 0)
```

The intuition here is that we're basically building a sum from the root down to a leaf; hence, it's helpful to send summation information down the tree from parents to children, which we can accomplish by using function parameters, specifically `sum_so_far` in the solution above.
