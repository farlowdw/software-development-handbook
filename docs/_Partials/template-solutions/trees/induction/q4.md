```python
def max_tree_val(root):
    if not root:
        return float('-inf')
    
    left = max_tree_val(root.left)
    right = max_tree_val(root.right)
    
    return max(root.val, left, right)
```

This is also a situation where it's completely possible and natural, albeit unnecessary, to find the maximum by "accumulating" the result in a `max_val` non-local variable which we update whenever we find a new maximum value (i.e., we're basically doing a for loop through all the nodes in the tree):

```python
def max_tree_val(root):
    max_val = root.val
    
    def visit(node):
        if not node:
            return float('-inf')
        
        nonlocal max_val
        max_val = max(max_val, node.val)
        
        visit(node.left)
        visit(node.right)
        
    visit(root)
    return max_val
```
