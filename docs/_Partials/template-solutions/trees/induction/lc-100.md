```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        
        if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        left = self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left)
        right = self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        
        return left and right
```

This is a great problem to solve with the induction template &#8212; the core idea is that if two trees are the same then their subtrees must also be the same. The recursive solution provides a natural way of solving this problem &#8212; return false if we ever encounter a condition that indicates (sub)trees are not the same (i.e., dissimilar missing nodes or unequal values). We return true if neither node exists, and this will be the terminating condition as we keep drilling down into the tree.
