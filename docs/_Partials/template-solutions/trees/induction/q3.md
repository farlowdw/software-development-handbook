```python
def tree_size(root):
    if not root:
        return 0

    left = tree_size(root.left)
    right = tree_size(root.right)
    
    return 1 + left + right
```

Count the total number of nodes in the tree by counting the nodes in each subtree and then add `1` for the root (this means we're always adding `1` for each node we encounter since each node encountered is treated as the root of its own subtree).
