```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        return left if left else right
```

This problem is a bit of a doozy if you have not yet seen it. Adding some code comments can help a great deal:

```python showLineNumbers
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # non-existent node cannot be LCA
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # current node is p or q -- return it because it could be the LCA (pre-order at this point)
        # stop searching further down this branch because the LCA cannot be deeper
        # any lower node along this branch would not be an ancestor to both p and q
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # all child nodes of current node have been visited (post-order at this point)
        # left/right will only hold non-null values if p or q (or both) were encountered
        #   (as children of the current node)
        # if left AND right are non-null, then LCA must be current node
        #   (it serves as the connector between the two subtrees containing p and q)
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        # both target nodes were not found in the current node's subtrees
        # either one target was found (return that node) or no target was found
        # (arbitrarily return right which will equal None)
        return left if left else right
```

Intuition for this problem can be gained by considering what properties the LCA must satisfy and how this fits in with our traversal strategy. Specifically, as we progress down a branch (i.e., consider pre-order logic), if we encounter a target node, then we should return it immediately because further exploring that branch serves no purpose &#8212; the LCA cannot possibly be at a greater depth than the current node (if it were, then it would exclude the current node which is a target node).

If the current node is *not* a target node, then we should keep exploring (i.e., we should explore the left *and* right subtrees of the current node). Specifically, it would help to have information about the child nodes of the current node being processed &#8212; we consider some post-order logic. If we explored the left and right branches of the current node and we found one target node in the left branch and another target node in the right branch, then this means the current node is the LCA and we should return it (it serves as the connecting node between the branches containing the targets).

What are the options at this point for the current node? 

- If we made it to the point of exploring the current node's left and right subtrees, then we know the current node is not one of the target nodes. (lines `10`-`11`)
- If our visits to the left and right subtrees of the current node did not *both* turn up successful searches, then the current node is *not* the LCA. (lines `21`-`22`)
- The only possibilities remaining are that a target node was found in one of the current node's subtrees or no target node was found at all. We return the target node *if it was found*; otherwise, we just arbitrarily return `right`, which will equal `None`. The last line of the solution above could just as well be `return right if right else left` to capture this logic.

It can be kind of difficult to imagine all of the logic above and how it actually *looks* when executed. To clarify things a bit, consider the following tree where we want to find the LCA of the nodes with values `6` and `4`:

```a
    ______3__
   /         \
  5__         1
 /   \       / \
6     2     0   8
     / \
    7   4
```

We can see from the tree display above that the answer will be `5`. But how does the logic in our solution actually unfold? The following image may help (nodes are in green; `left` and `right` value resolutions, `L` and `R`, respectively, are in blue, where `N` represents `None`; red numbers above each value resolution indicate the order in which that value resolution was made):

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='650px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/trees/f2.jpg').default} />
</div>

The image makes it clear how we *do not* continue processing a branch once a target node is found along that branch. Unfortunately, there's a clear inefficiency highlighted in the process pictured above &#8212; we still process the overall root's entire right subtree even though it's clearly not possible for the LCA to exist within it since both target nodes have already been found. Fixing this inefficiency would require a good bit more effort, but is worth considering at some point. The main goal of the picture is to illustrate how searches are executed and terminated and how values found are propagated back up the tree.
