The solution above is straight from [LeetCode's solution editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/solution/). It is posted as a reminder to come back to it at another date, mostly due to the following [comment](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/solution/413322):

> The solution seems to clone the value at successor or predecessor instead of actually moving either of them up the tree at all. An interviewer can reasonably argue that this is not actually deleting a node because the node remains in the tree with an updated value from either predecessor or successor.

That is, the provided solution *does not* actually delete the node but simply overwrites values of other nodes to fulfill the BST property. One user refers people on to [Java code](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/BST.java.html) from Sedgewick's famed *algorithms* text.

This would be a good problem to come back to.
