```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        
        left = self.inorderTraversal(root.left)
        right = self.inorderTraversal(root.right)
        
        return left + [root.val] + right
```

The approach above is inductive &#8212; each node passes to its parent the list of nodes in its subtree. But this means each node creates its own list by copying and concatenating the lists of its children, a questionable use of space for this problem. We can avoid the copying of intermediate results by using a "global list" to accumulate nodes as they are visited in the order in which they are visited (in-order in this case):

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        node_vals = []
        
        def visit(node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            visit(node.left)
            node_vals.append(node.val)
            visit(node.right)
            
        visit(root)
        return node_vals
```
