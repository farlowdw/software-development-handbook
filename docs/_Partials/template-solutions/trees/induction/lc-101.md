import LC from '@site/src/components/LC';

```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(node1, node2):
            if not node1 and not node2:
                return True
        
            if not node1 or not node2 or node1.val != node2.val:
                return False
            
            return dfs(node1.left, node2.right) and dfs(node1.right, node2.left)
        
        return dfs(root, root)
```

The solution above is not the easiest to come up with at first. In many ways, this problem resembles <LC id='100' type='long' ></LC>. Compare the solutions:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        
        if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        left = self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left)
        right = self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        
        return left and right
```

The idea is that our DFS needs to be acting on the same node each time in two different ways &#8212; the left subtree of a node needs to mirror that same node's right subtree. This becomes possible when we allow our DFS function to receive two nodes as parameters.

The more intuitive, albeit slightly messier, approach is a modified BFS:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def test_level(level_nodes):
            l = 0
            r = len(level_nodes) - 1
            while l < r:
                left = level_nodes[l]
                right = level_nodes[r]
                l += 1
                r -= 1
                if not left and not right:
                    continue
                if (left and not right) or (right and not left) or left.val != right.val:
                    return False
            
            return True
        
        queue = deque([root])
        while queue:
            if not test_level(queue):
                return False
            num_nodes_this_level = len(queue)
            for _ in range(num_nodes_this_level):
                node = queue.popleft()
                if node:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                    queue.append(node.right)
                     
        return True
```

The idea here is that we *always* push a node's children to the queue. We do this even if one of the children does not exist *to ensure positions are maintained*. Mirrored nodes to be equidistant from each other. Note that the lines

```python
num_nodes_this_level = len(queue)
for _ in range(num_nodes_this_level):
```

are critical in the function above to ensure the `test_level` function is run *only when an entire level has been enqueued*.
