```python
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def visit(node, max_so_far):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            left = visit(node.left, max(max_so_far, node.val))
            right = visit(node.right, max(max_so_far, node.val))

            ans = left + right
            if node.val >= max_so_far:
                ans += 1

            return ans

        return visit(root, float("-inf"))
```

The inductive solution for this problem, provided above, is arguably more difficult to come up with than its "traverse and accumulate" alternative (provided below). But both approaches use the same critical idea, namely passing down the maximum value of a node encountered on the path so far to determine whether or not the current node value exceeds or equals that value (in which case the current node is a good node).

This is a good problem for the induction template though because we can definitely solve it by amassing all the good nodes on a subtree by subtree basis, accumulating the final value in the root. The solution above makes use of a post-order traversal to do this, where we start adding values to the overall answer once we hit a leaf node (the overall maximum for that path is recorded in the `max_so_far` variable). This is different from how the number of good nodes is accumulated using the traverse and accumulate approach where a pre-order traversal is used:

```python
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        good_nodes = 0
        def visit(node, max_so_far):
            nonlocal good_nodes
            if not node:
                return
            
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, node.val)
            if node.val >= max_so_far:
                good_nodes += 1
            
            visit(node.left, max_so_far)
            visit(node.right, max_so_far)
        
        visit(root, root.val)
        return good_nodes
```
