```python
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        min_diff = float('inf')
        prev = float('-inf')
        
        def visit(node):
            nonlocal min_diff, prev
            if not node:
                return
            
            visit(node.left)
            
            min_diff = min(min_diff, node.val - prev)
            prev = node.val
            
            visit(node.right)
            
            return node.val
            
        visit(root)
        return min_diff
```

The key realization here is that an in-order traversal gives us the node values in sorted ascending order. Hence, we can make use of a `prev` variable to store the value of previous nodes and we compare adjacent nodes as we go, keeping track of the minimum difference encountered, `min_diff`, along the way. In the code above, note that `min_diff` and `prev` are initialized in ways that ensure calculations are meaningful for two or more nodes, which we're guaranteed to have in this problem.
