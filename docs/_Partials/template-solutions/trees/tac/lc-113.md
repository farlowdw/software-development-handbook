```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        paths = []
        def dfs(node, sum_so_far, path_vals):
            if not node:
                return
            
            sum_so_far += node.val
            path_vals.append(node.val)
            if sum_so_far == targetSum and not node.left and not node.right:
                paths.append(path_vals[:])
            
            dfs(node.left, sum_so_far, path_vals)
            dfs(node.right, sum_so_far, path_vals)
            
            path_vals.pop()
            
        dfs(root, 0, [])
        return paths
```

This is a lovely problem, especially for the traverse-and-accumulate template. The main wrinkle is the need for the backtracking bit: `path_vals.pop()`. This line occurs *after* the subtree for a node has been processed and that node should be removed from consideration for a path. Another potential gotcha is the line once the target sum has been reached at a leaf node: `paths.append(path_vals[:])`. If, instead, we had `paths.append(path_vals)`, then we'd encounter some errors because `path_vals` is a *list* which means it is mutable, but we do not want to mutate the list we end up pushing to `paths`; hence, we make a *copy* of `path_vals` when the target sum is reached and we push *that copy* to `paths`.
