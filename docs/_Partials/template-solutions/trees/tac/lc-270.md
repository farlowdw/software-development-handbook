```python
class Solution:
    def closestValue(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: float) -> int:
        val = root.val
        curr_diff = abs(val - target)
        
        def visit(node):
            nonlocal val, curr_diff
            if not node:
                return
            
            diff = abs(node.val - target)
            if diff <= curr_diff:
                if diff != curr_diff:
                    curr_diff = diff
                    val = node.val
                else:
                    val = min(val, node.val)
            
            if target > node.val:
                visit(node.right)
            elif target < node.val:
                visit(node.left)
            else:
                val = node.val
                
        visit(root)
        return val
```

The solution above is, oddly enough, probably the easiest of the approaches to come up with where we're both taking advantage of the BST tree structure as well as not allocating additional space beyond the call stack for the recursion.

If, however, we allow ourselves the freedom to perform an in-order traversal where we just assemble a sorted array ($O(n)$ additional space to store all the node values), then we can easily iterate through the sorted array to find the closest value:

```python
class Solution:
    def closestValue(self, root: TreeNode, target: float) -> int:
        def inorder(node):
            return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right) if node else []
        
        return min(inorder(root), key = lambda x: abs(target - x))
```

This is cute and short but not particularly clever since we create an array the full size of the tree just to store the node values when that's really unnecessary.
