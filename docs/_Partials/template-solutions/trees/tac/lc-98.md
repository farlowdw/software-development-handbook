```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        is_bst = True
        prev = float('-inf')
        
        def visit(node):
            nonlocal is_bst, prev
            
            if not node or not is_bst:
                return
            
            visit(node.left)
            
            if prev >= node.val:
                is_bst = False
            prev = node.val
            
            visit(node.right)
        
        visit(root)
        return is_bst
```

The solution above is slick in terms of how it uses `prev` to bypass adding a bunch of space overhead to the solution. It's sort of "linked list-ish" in nature in terms of how the `prev` "pointer" is being used and updated. A more obvious solution that results in adding a bunch of space is as follows (this just assembles the array of node values and we check to see if it is sorted or not &#8212; both solutions are $O(n)$ for time and space, but the solution above is more elegant):

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        node_vals = []
        
        def visit(node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            visit(node.left)
            node_vals.append(node.val)
            visit(node.right)
            
        visit(root)
        for i in range(1, len(node_vals)):
            if node_vals[i - 1] >= node_vals[i]:
                return False
            
        return True
```
