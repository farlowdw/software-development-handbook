```python
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return root
        
        level_node_vals_rightmost = []
        def visit(node, level):
            if not node:
                return
            
            if level == len(level_node_vals_rightmost):
                level_node_vals_rightmost.append(node.val)
                
            visit(node.right, level + 1)
            visit(node.left, level + 1)
                
        visit(root, 0)
        return level_node_vals_rightmost

The BFS approach to this problem is a bit clearer to envision, but a clever DFS solution is also quite possible, as evidenced above. Specifically, this problem is an *excellent* illustration of where logic in the pre-order stage of a traversal can be very helpful. The *right side view* dictates that we always report the value of the rightmost node for each level of the tree. We're not guaranteed that each node will have a right child. For some levels, a node's *left* child may actually be the level's rightmost node whose value we need to report. The key insight is to use a right-to-left traversal where in the pre-order stage we determine whether or not the current node's value should be added to the list we're ultimately trying to return &#8212; we cleverly use the length of the list to determine whether or not a node's value should be added.
