```python
def longest_vertical_path(root):
    longest_path = 0
    
    def visit(node, curr_path_val, curr_path_length):
        if not node:
            return
        
        nonlocal longest_path
        if node.val == curr_path_val:
            curr_path_length += 1
            longest_path = max(longest_path, curr_path_length)
        else:
            curr_path_length = 0
        
        visit(node.left, node.val, curr_path_length)
        visit(node.right, node.val, curr_path_length)
    
    visit(root, root.val, 0)
    return longest_path
```

The idea is to keep track of the longest univalue vertical path found so far by storing it in a nonlocal variable, `longest_path`. To calculate the longest vertical path for any given node, we pass that node's value down the tree as well as the current path length where that is the only value encountered thus far.
