```python
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(node, leaf_vals):
            if not node:
                return
            
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                leaf_vals.append(node.val)
                
            dfs(node.left, leaf_vals)
            dfs(node.right, leaf_vals)
            
            return leaf_vals
        
        t1_leaf_vals = dfs(root1, [])
        t2_leaf_vals = dfs(root2, [])
        
        if len(t1_leaf_vals) != len(t2_leaf_vals):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(t1_leaf_vals)):
            if t1_leaf_vals[i] != t2_leaf_vals[i]:
                return False
            
        return True
```

The core idea above is to traverse each tree, accumulating the leaf values in each and then compare those values. Another more nifty and Pythonic approach is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1, root2):
        def dfs(node):
            if node:
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    yield node.val
                yield from dfs(node.left)
                yield from dfs(node.right)

        return list(dfs(root1)) == list(dfs(root2))
```
