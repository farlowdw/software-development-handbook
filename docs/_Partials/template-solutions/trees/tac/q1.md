```python
def max_diff(root):
    if not root:
        return 0

    min_val = float('inf')
    max_val = float('-inf')
    
    def visit(node):
        if not node:
            return
        
        nonlocal min_val, max_val
        min_val = min(min_val, node.val)
        max_val = max(max_val, node.val)
        
        visit(node.left)
        visit(node.right)
        
    visit(root)
    return max_val - min_val
```

The largest difference between nodes could be between nodes deeper down in the left and right subtrees of the tree's overall root; that is, we cannot effectively determine the answer for the whole tree from the answers for the subtrees. The induction template is thus not applicable. We can traverse and accumulate the overall maximum and minimum node values in non-local variables `min_val` and `max_val`. We report the answer after a full traversal by returning the difference between these values.
