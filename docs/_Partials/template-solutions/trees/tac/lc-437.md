```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        def dfs(node, path_sum):
            if not node:
                return
            
            nonlocal ans
            path_sum += node.val
            ans += counts[path_sum - targetSum]
            counts[path_sum] += 1
            
            dfs(node.left, path_sum)
            dfs(node.right, path_sum)
            
            counts[path_sum] -= 1
            
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        counts[0] = 1
        ans = 0
        
        dfs(root, 0)
        
        return ans
```

The solution above cleverly exploits the idea of a sort of progressive prefix sum where the *frequency* of prefix sums encountered is tracked in the `counts` hash map. The backtracking part `counts[path_sum] -= 1` is important for once the current node is no longer part of the path sum (i.e., the frequency for that path sum should then be decremented by 1).
