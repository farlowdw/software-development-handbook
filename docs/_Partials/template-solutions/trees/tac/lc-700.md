```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        target_node = None
        
        def visit(node):
            nonlocal target_node
            if not node or target_node:
                return
            
            if node.val > val:
                visit(node.left)
            elif node.val < val:
                visit(node.right)
            else:
                target_node = node
                            
        visit(root)
        return target_node
```

This problem has an easy solution if you don't take advantage of the fact that the tree is a BST:

```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        target_node = None
        
        def visit(node):
            nonlocal target_node
            if not node or target_node:
                return
            
            if node.val == val:
                target_node = node
            
            visit(node.left)
            visit(node.right)
            
        visit(root)
        return target_node
```

But that's not the point of the problem. Only a small adjustment needs to be made in order to really take advantage of the fact that the tree is a BST. Only visit a node in a subsequent subtree if it's possible for that subtree to have the node.
