```python
class Solution:
    def bstToGst(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        sum_so_far = 0
        
        def visit(node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            visit(node.right)
            
            nonlocal sum_so_far
            sum_so_far += node.val
            node.val = sum_so_far
            
            visit(node.left)
            
        visit(root)
        return root
```

First recall that a conventional (i.e., left to right) in-order traversal of a BST results in traversing the nodes in *sorted ascending order*. Sometimes, like in this problem, it helps to execute an in-order traversal from right to left, which will yield values in sorted *descending* order. This realization makes this problem much easier to approach. Execute a right to left in-order traversal and update each node's value to `sum_so_far`, an accumulated sum of all node values reached thus far.
