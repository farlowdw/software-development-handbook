```python
def node_height(root, target):
    target_height = -1
    
    def visit(node):
        if not node:
            return -1
        
        left_height = visit(node.left)
        right_height = visit(node.right)
        
        height = 1 + max(left_height, right_height)
        
        if node.val == target:
            nonlocal target_height
            target_height = height
        
        return height
    
    visit(root)
    return target_height
```

This problem assumes our tree is comprised of nodes with unique values. It helps to do a post-order traversal here, where we build the height up *from the leaf nodes*, and we only update the nonlocal `target_height` once the target value has been encountered for the node whose height we're trying to find.

Remember that a node's *height* is the longest path from the node to a leaf whereas a node's *depth* is the length of the path from the root of the tree to that node:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='400px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/trees/f1.png').default} />
</div>
