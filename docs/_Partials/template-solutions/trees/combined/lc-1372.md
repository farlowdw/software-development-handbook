```python
class Solution:
    def longestZigZag(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        path_length = 0
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return (0,0)
            
            left = dfs(node.left)[0]
            right = dfs(node.right)[1]
            
            nonlocal path_length
            path_length = max(path_length, left, right)
            return (right + 1, left + 1)
            
        dfs(root)
        return path_length
```

This problem is a real doozy at first. The solution above is based on [this excellent solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/solution/1868012). The idea is to return values in a tuple in such a way that the path length keeps increasing by `1` (from the bottom due to the post-order traversal) so long as the zigzag pattern is maintained (the zigzag pattern is maintained by swapping the order of the returned values for each DFS call) or a value of `0` is returned, in which case the path length for that zigzag is effectively reset.

An illustrative example can help a great deal. Consider the following tree:

```a
  __2
 /   \
3     12______
 \            \
  1        ____7_____
          /          \
         8__       ___5
            \     /    \
             9   4      11
            /     \
           6       10
```

The tree above can be used as a test case on LeetCode by defining the tree as follows:

```
[2,3,12,null,1,null,7,null,null,8,5,null,9,4,11,6,null,null,10]
```

The longest zigzag path is `12 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6` (right, left, right, left for a path length of `4`). How is this path length actually calculated with the solution above though? Drawing a picture always helps:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='900px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/trees/f3.png').default} />
</div>

One thing to note about the image: the `L` and `R` value for each node is obtained by the tuple value returned by the left child at index `0` and the tuple value returned by the right child at index `1`, respectively. For example, the node with value `5` has a left child that returns `(2,1)` and a right child that returns `(1,1)`; hence, `L` and `R` for the node with value `5` is `2` from `(2,1)` and `1` from `(1,1)`:

```a
(2,1)   (1,1)
 L         R
```

Adding a print statement right before the return within the `dfs` function can help clarify and confirm the process illustrated above:

```python
print(f'Node: {node.val}; L = {left}; R = {right}; Return: ({right + 1},{left + 1})')
```

The following is printed to the console:

```a
Node:  1; L = 0; R = 0; Return: (1,1)
Node:  3; L = 0; R = 1; Return: (2,1)
Node:  6; L = 0; R = 0; Return: (1,1)
Node:  9; L = 1; R = 0; Return: (1,2)
Node:  8; L = 0; R = 2; Return: (3,1)
Node: 10; L = 0; R = 0; Return: (1,1)
Node:  4; L = 0; R = 1; Return: (2,1)
Node: 11; L = 0; R = 0; Return: (1,1)
Node:  5; L = 2; R = 1; Return: (2,3)
Node:  7; L = 3; R = 3; Return: (4,4)
Node: 12; L = 0; R = 4; Return: (5,1)
Node:  2; L = 2; R = 1; Return: (2,3)
```

This confirms everything illustrated in the image. Note that since `path_length` is calculated as `path_length = max(path_length, left, right)` *before* the tuple return `(right + 1, left + 1)`, we can see from the above that our final maximum `path_length` value is `4` (one unit less than 5).
