```python
class Solution:
    def isEvenOddTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        queue = deque([root])
        required_remainder = 1
        
        while queue:
            num_nodes_this_level = len(queue)
            most_recent_val = float('-inf') if required_remainder else float('inf')
            for _ in range(num_nodes_this_level):
                node = queue.popleft()
                
                if node.val % 2 != required_remainder:
                    return False
                elif required_remainder and most_recent_val >= node.val:
                    return False
                elif not required_remainder and most_recent_val <= node.val:
                    return False
                
                most_recent_val = node.val
                
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

            required_remainder = (required_remainder + 1) % 2
        
        return True
```

This is a tougher BFS problem, one that is deceptively more difficult than it appears to be at first glance. The solution above relies on exploiting the truthy or falsy nature of `required_remainder` for a number of things, including parity checks.
