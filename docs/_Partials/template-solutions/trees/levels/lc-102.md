```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return root
        
        levels = []
        queue = deque([root])
        while queue:
            level_vals = []
            num_nodes_this_level = len(queue)
            for _ in range(num_nodes_this_level):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level_vals.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            levels.append(level_vals)
        return levels
```

Most BFS problems require some ingenuity, but this problem is mostly a basic test &#8212; the primary gotcha can occur if you don't account for a missing root properly. The rest of the solution is simply traversing level by level and pushing each level's values to `level_vals` before pushing `level_vals` to `levels` once the level has been entirely processed.
