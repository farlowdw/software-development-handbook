                level_node_vals.append(node.val)
                if node.left:

                    queue.append(node.right)
                    
            if not LEFT_RIGHT:
                left = 0
                right = len(level_node_vals) - 1
                while left < len(level_node_vals) // 2:
                    level_node_vals[left], level_node_vals[right] = level_node_vals[right], level_node_vals[left]
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1
                    
            node_vals.append(level_node_vals)

```

There are several ways to try to solve this problem, but each approach seems to involve something somewhat unnatural:

- we could use a deque for each level's values where we append to the right or append to the left depending on the level (but most BFS problems aren't supposed to explicitly rely on using deques)
- we could treat the values accumulated for each level as a stack and pop the values from the stack into another list when a right to left order is desired (but this is expensive for time and space)
- and so on

The solution above explicitly reverses a level's node values in-place, if needed. The additional space requirement is minimal since the reversal is in-place. The additional time required is also somewhat minimal since we only iterate over half the length of a level's values (the multi-deque approach avoids this additional time cost, but the use of a deque for each level seems quite unnatural).
