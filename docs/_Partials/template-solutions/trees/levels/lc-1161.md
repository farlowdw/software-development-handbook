```python
class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        max_level = 0
        level = 0
        max_level_sum = float('-inf')
        queue = deque([root])
        while queue:
            level += 1
            level_sum = 0
            num_nodes_this_level = len(queue)
            for i in range(num_nodes_this_level):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level_sum += node.val
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            if level_sum > max_level_sum:
                max_level = level
                max_level_sum = level_sum
                
        return max_level
```

This is a fun one. Keep track of which level you are processing as well as its sum. Only update `max_level` and `max_level_sum` if the current level sum is greater than all previously encountered level sums.
