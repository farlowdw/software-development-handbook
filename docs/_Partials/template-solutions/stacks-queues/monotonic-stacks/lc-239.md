```python
class Solution:

        n = len(nums)
        dec_queue = deque() # monotonic deque (weakly decreasing)
        ans = []
        for i in range(n):
            curr_num = nums[i]
            # maintain the weakly decreasing deque
            while dec_queue and nums[dec_queue[-1]] < curr_num:
                dec_queue.pop()
            
            # check to see if leftmost value of the deque
            # is now actually an invalid index
            if dec_queue and dec_queue[0] == i - k:
                dec_queue.popleft()
            
            dec_queue.append(i)
            
            # only add window maximums to the answer array
            # once the required length has been reached
            if i >= k - 1:
                ans.append(nums[dec_queue[0]])
