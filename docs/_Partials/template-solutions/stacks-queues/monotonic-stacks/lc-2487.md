```python
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(float('inf'))
        sentinel.next = head
        curr = head
        stack = [sentinel]
         
        while curr:
            while stack and stack[-1].val < curr.val:
                stack.pop()
            
            stack[-1].next = curr
            stack.append(curr)
            curr = curr.next
        
        return sentinel.next
```

For each node, its previous "greater than or equal to" node should be linked to it; that is, maintaining a weakly decreasing monotonic stack gives us what we want by first pushing to it the sentinel node whose value is infinite (positively). This means our stack will *never* be empty; hence, we do not always need to make the check `if stack` as we might normally have to otherwise. The pointer manipulation here is really quite clever.
