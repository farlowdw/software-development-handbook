```python
class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(prices)
        stack = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            val_B = prices[i]
            while stack and prices[stack[-1]] >= val_B:
                idx_val_A = stack.pop()
                prices[idx_val_A] -= val_B # val_B is discount since it is next less or equal value to val_A
            stack.append(i)
        
        return prices
```
