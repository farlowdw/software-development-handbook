```python

        # query the next smaller value for each index of nums
        # the current index will be the included left endpoint 
        # and the queried value will be the excluded right endpoint
        # total number of subarrays contributed where the left endpoint
        # is the minimum: right - left (since right is excluded)
        for left in range(n):

            ans += right - left # NOT "right - left + 1" because right is not included here
