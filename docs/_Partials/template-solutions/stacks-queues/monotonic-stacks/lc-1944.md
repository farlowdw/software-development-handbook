```python
class Solution:
    def canSeePersonsCount(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(heights)
        ans = [0] * n
        stack = [] # monotonic stack (decreasing)
        
        for i in range(n):
            curr_height = heights[i]
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] < curr_height:
                idx_prev_smaller_height = stack.pop()
                ans[idx_prev_smaller_height] += 1
            
            if stack:
                ans[stack[-1]] += 1
                
            stack.append(i)
            
        return ans
