```python
class RecentCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = deque()

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.queue.append(t)
        while self.queue[-1] < t - 3000:
            self.queue.popleft()
        return len(self.queue)
```

**Time:** $O(1)$. This is due to the fact that a total of `t - (t - 3000) + 1 = 3001` elements can be in the range `[t - 3000, t]`, which means the loop in `ping` may fire up to `3000` times in the worst case, which is a constant.

**Space:** $O(1)$. The max size of the queue is `3001`, as noted above, which is a constant.

The most recently added element will automatically be part of the number of "recent" calls. To determine *all* recent calls, we need to remove the *previous* calls not within the specified range of `[t - 3000, t]`. A queue is the right data structure for this.
