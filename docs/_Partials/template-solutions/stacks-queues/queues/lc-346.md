```python
class MovingAverage:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.queue = deque()
        self.queue_sum = 0
        self.size = size

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        self.queue.append(val)
        self.queue_sum += val
        if len(self.queue) > self.size:
            self.queue_sum -= self.queue.popleft()
        return self.queue_sum / len(self.queue)
```

**Time:** $O(1)$. The data stream is moving, which means we never process elements in aggregate.

**Space:** $O(n)$. Let $n$ represent the size of the moving window. This is the maximum space consumed in the solution above.

There's nothing to prevent us from keeping track of the total window sum, which we can effectively use the queue to adjust by subtracting elements out of the window (first in first out) and adding new elements to the window.
