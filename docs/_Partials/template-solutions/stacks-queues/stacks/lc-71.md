```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for portion in path.split('/'):
            if portion == '' or portion == '.':
                continue
            elif portion == '..':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(portion)
        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. It takes $O(n)$ time to process all characters in `path` when executing `path.split('/')`, and there's also a smaller cost in comparing the `portion` substrings to pre-defined special character groups (i.e., `''`, `'.'`, and `'..'`).

**Space:** $O(n)$. It takes $O(n)$ space to aggregate the groups in `path.split('/')` and $O(n)$ space to build the canonical path in `stack`, resulting in an overall space complexity of $O(n)$.

LIFO property at work in this problem: Only ever add valid file/directory names to the stack. If you encounter `..`, then remove the most recently seen file or directory name. If you encounter other characters such as `''` or `'.'`, then it's a no-op and you should continue on with your processing. At the end, return a string joined with `/` separators (the first `/` needs to be manually inserted).

One of the tricks in this problem is to only aggregate directory *names* as opposed to operations on those directories. The operations dictate how we manage the stack (as alluded to above).
