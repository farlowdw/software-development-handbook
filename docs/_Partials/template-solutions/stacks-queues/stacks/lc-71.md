```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for portion in path.split('/'):
            if portion == '' or portion == '.':
                continue
            elif portion == '..':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(portion)
        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

**FIFO property:** Only ever add valid file/directory names to the stack. If you encounter `..`, then remove the most recently seen file or directory name. If you encounter other characters such as `''` or `'.'`, then it's a no-op and you should continue on with your processing. At the end, return a string joined with `/` separators (the first `/` needs to be manually inserted).
