```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if stack and abs(ord(stack[-1]) - ord(char)) == 32:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. The entire input string is processed, and it takes time $O(1)$ to process each character individually.

**Space:** $O(n)$. The stack size could become as large as the input string itself.

The LIFO property at work in this problem: The last character added to the stack is the first one out if its corresponding upper- or lower-case character is the one currently being considered.
