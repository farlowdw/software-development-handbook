```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if stack and abs(ord(stack[-1]) - ord(char)) == 32:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return "".join(stack)
```

**FIFO property:** The last character added to the stack is the first one out if its corresponding upper- or lower-case character is the one currently being considered.
