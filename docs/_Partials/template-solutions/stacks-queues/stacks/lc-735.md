```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        history = []
        for asteroid in asteroids:
            history.append(asteroid)
            while len(history) > 1 and history[-2] > 0 and history[-1] < 0:
                prev = history[-2]
                curr = history[-1]
                if prev > abs(curr):
                    history.pop()
                elif prev < abs(curr):
                    curr = history.pop()
                    history.pop()
                    history.append(curr)
                else:
                    history.pop()
                    history.pop()
                    
        return history
```

The main challenge here is to implement the solution in as *clean* a manner as possible. The actual problem statement is simple enough, but laying out the solution carefully takes a bit of thought:

- We should maintain a history of all asteroids we've seen. It only makes sense to consider *removing* asteroids from the history if the history has more than a single asteroid, hence the while loop condition `len(history) > 1`.
- Since we'll be processing asteroids from left to right, asteroid collisions can only happen when the last asteroid in the history is going right and the current asteroid is going left; hence, we have the following condition *after* adding the current asteroid to the history: `history[-2] > 0 and history[-1] < 0`.
- Finally, we can proceed with handling the core conditions of the problem:
  + If the previous asteroid has a greater size than the current one, then the current asteroid gets exploded (i.e., removed from the history).
  + If, however, the previous asteroid's size is actually smaller than the current one, then the previous asteroid needs to be removed. But the current one is at the top of the history; hence, we temporarily remove the top of the history in order to remove the previous asteroid that exploded (then we add the current asteroid back).
  + The only other possibility would be for the asteroids to have the same size, in which case *both* asteroids explode, and they should both be removed from the history.
