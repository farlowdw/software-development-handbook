    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:

            ')': '(',
            '}': '{',

        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if char in lookup:
                if not stack or lookup[char] != stack.pop():
                    return False

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each character in the input string is processed, and it takes $O(1)$ time to process each individual character.

**Space:** $O(n)$. If the input string is comprised of only opening delimiters, then the stack will grow to be the size of the input string.

<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

The LIFO pattern exhibited for this problem is the following: The last (most recent) opening delimiter is the first to be deleted.

The "correct" order is determined by whatever the previous opening bracket was. Whenever there is a closing bracket, it should correspond to the most recent opening bracket. We can effectively test for this in an iterative fashion by maintaining a history (stack) of the encountered opening delimiters. As soon as we encounter a closing delimiter, if the element on top of the stack doesn't correspond (or if the stack is empty), then we know we cannot have a list of valid parentheses and we can return `False`; otherwise, the current character is an opening delimiter and we add it to the stack.

Once we've completed iterating through all characters, if the stack of opening delimiters is empty, then we know all delimiters have a valid correspondence, and we can return `True`.
