```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def build_str(r):
            stack = []
            for char in r:
                if char == '#':
                    if stack:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(char)
            return "".join(stack)
        
        s_str = build_str(s)
        t_str = build_str(t)
        return s_str == t_str
```

**LIFO property:** Maintaining a *history* of characters seen and *deleting* the most recently seen ones when encounter `#` characters.

The stack-based solution is quick and easy since `#` characters almost literally allow us to backspace by removing (deleting) characters from the stack that maintains a history of the characters seen so far. A more complicated but elegant solution is a two-pointer approach.
