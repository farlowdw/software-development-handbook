```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def typed_str(r):
            stack = []
            for char in r:
                if char == '#':
                    if stack:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(char)
            return ''.join(stack)
        
        return typed_str(s) == typed_str(t)
```

**Time:** $O(m + n)$. Let the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` be `m` and `n`, respectively. Both strings are processed in a linear fashion, and it takes $O(1)$ time to process each character.

**Space:** $O(m + n)$. If no backspaces are encountered, then the memory consumed will be proportional to the length of `s` and `t`, combined.

The following LIFO property is on display in this problem: Maintaining a *history* of characters seen and *deleting* the most recently seen ones when `#` characters are encountered.

The stack-based solution is quick and easy since `#` characters almost literally allow us to backspace by removing (deleting) characters from the stack that maintains a history of the characters seen so far. A more complicated but elegant solution is a two-pointer approach.
