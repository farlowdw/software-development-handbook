```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if stack and stack[-1] == char:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

**Time:** $O(n)$. Each character in the input string is processed, and it takes $O(1)$ time to process each character.

**Space:** $O(n)$. If all characters are unique, then the stack will grow to be the size of the input string.

<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

The LIFO pattern exhibited in this problem is the following: The last (most recent) character is the first to be deleted.

The example of `s = "azxxzy"` resolving to `"ay"` highlights the strategy we should use here, namely determining whether or not the current character ever equals the element on top of the stack. If so, then remove the element from the top of the stack and continue on (this effectively deletes both elements); otherwise, add the current element to the stack.
