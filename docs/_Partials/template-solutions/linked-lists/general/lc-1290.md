```python
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        curr = head
        ans = curr.val
        
        while curr.next:
            ans = ans * 2 + curr.next.val
            curr = curr.next
            
        return ans
```

The idea behind the clever solution above is easier to understand if we first consider a simple base-10 number by itself: `4836`. What this *means* in a base-10 system is the following (the powers of 10 indicate positional significance of the different numerals): $4\cdot 10^3 + 8\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 10^1 + 6\cdot 10^0 = (4836)_{10}$. 

How does this help with this problem? Well, consider how the number `4836` could be obtained if we encountered the digits one at a time, left to right:

```
ans = 4
    = 4 * 10 + 8      -> (48)
    = 48 * 10 + 3     -> (483)
    = 483 * 10 + 6    -> (4836)
    = 4836
```

The same thing is happening in this problem with respect to another base, namely base 2. For example, consider how the process above would look for the following number (in base 2): `101101`:

```
ans = 1
    = 1 * 2 + 0     -> (2)
    = 2 * 2 + 1     -> (5)
    = 5 * 2 + 1     -> (11)
    = 11 * 2 + 0    -> (22)
    = 22 * 2 + 1    -> (45)
    = 45
```

The solution above is elegant in exploiting this instead of doing something else unnecessary like reversing the list and then updating the answer as we go along (which might be the first solution idea):

```python
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        def reverse(node):
            prev = None
            curr = node
            while curr:
                next_node = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = next_node
            return prev
        
        curr = reverse(head)
        ans = 0
        pos = 0
        
        while curr:
            if curr.val == 1:
                ans += 2 ** pos
            curr = curr.next
            pos += 1
        
        return ans
```
