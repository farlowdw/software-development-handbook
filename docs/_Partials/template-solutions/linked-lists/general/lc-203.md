```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev = sentinel
        curr = prev.next
        
        while curr:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = prev.next.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        
        return sentinel.next
```

The key idea is that we only ever actually move `prev` when a non-`val` number is encountered; otherwise, we simply skip or "delete" nodes via `prev.next = prev.next.next` while constantly moving forward through the list with `curr = curr.next`.
