```python
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        def swap_nodes(prev_left, prev_right):
            if not prev_left or not prev_right \
                or not prev_left.next or not prev_right.next \
                    or prev_left.next == prev_right.next:
                return
            
            left = prev_left.next
            right = prev_right.next
            prev_left.next, prev_right.next = right, left
            right.next, left.next = left.next, right.next
        
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev_left = sentinel
        prev_right = sentinel.next
        
        while prev_left and prev_right:
            swap_nodes(prev_left, prev_right)
            prev_left = prev_right
            prev_right = prev_right.next
            
        return sentinel.next
```

The while loop condition conveys that we are only ever interested in trying to swap two nodes if both of their predecessors exist. Since this problem involves swapping *pairs* of nodes (i.e., the nodes are adjacent), the `prev_left` condition in the while loop is actually unnecessary (`prev_right` can only be true if `prev_left` is also true). 

The main potential "gotcha" occurs after the swapping of the nodes. Note that `prev_left` and `prev_right` are *never* reassigned during the node swapping but their `next` attributes are. This means we need to be somewhat careful when making reassignments. As always, a drawing of a simple example can be immensely helpful:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='800px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/linked-lists/f9.png').default} />
</div>

Now the solution above basically suggests itself.
