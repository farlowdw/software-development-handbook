```python
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        def swap_nodes(prev_left, prev_right):
            if not prev_left or not prev_right \
                or not prev_left.next or not prev_right.next \
                    or prev_left.next == prev_right.next:
                        return
                    
            left = prev_left.next
            right = prev_right.next
            prev_left.next, prev_right.next = right, left
            right.next, left.next = left.next, right.next
            
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev_left = prev_right = sentinel
        null_checker = head
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            prev_left = prev_left.next
            null_checker = null_checker.next
            
        while null_checker.next:
            prev_right = prev_right.next
            null_checker = null_checker.next
        
        swap_nodes(prev_left, prev_right)
        return sentinel.next
```

The motivation for the "swap two nodes" template really comes from this problem. Coming up with the template is the harder part &#8212; now all we have to do is work on identifying which nodes precede the `left` and `right` nodes.
