This is such an excellent problem. The solution above, originally inspired [by this one](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups/discuss/3832053/Clean-python-solution-simple-beats-100-explanation), is brilliant in how it fulfills the problem's requirements and deftly utilizes reversing a specified number of nodes in place.

How does the solution logic work apart from `reverse_k_nodes`? First, recall what `reverse_k_nodes` does apart from reversing `k` nodes in-place: it *returns* the last node of the reversed segment. With this in mind, there are a few key points to highlight to illustrate how and why the solution above works:

- We will maintain a `connector` node that allows us to keep all groups of the list connected. This node will always directly precede the beginning of a group.
- It's easy to get lost in keeping track of the odd or even groups, especially since the last group has to be treated differently than all the rest. A clever way of treating everything in a uniform fashion is to keep track of what the current group's full size would be, `grp_size` as well as the current node count, `count`, as we move our way through the list.
- How do we move from one group to another effectively? We do so by determining whether or not the current node count equals the full size of the current group (i.e., `grp_size == count`) or if there aren't any nodes left to process, in which case we are done iterating and need to process the last group (i.e., `not curr.next`).

  In both cases mentioned above, if the number of nodes in the group is even, then we need to reverse all these nodes in the group, and then continue on. Since `reverse_k_nodes` returns the last node of the newly reversed segment, we can set `curr` equal to this function's return value. What remains is to set `connect = curr` before moving to the next group. We also add `1` to the next group's size, `grp_size += 1`, and we reset `count = 0` because we add `1` to `count` after the if block no matter what happens.
