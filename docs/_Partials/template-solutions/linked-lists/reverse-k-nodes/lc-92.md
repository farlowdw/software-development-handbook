**Time:** $O(n)$. The entire list is processed in a linear fashion.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Additional memory is not consumed as the input size grows.

The template for reversing `k` nodes in-place was born out of the efforts to find a nice solution for this problem. The main potential "gotcha" is when `left = 1`, where the `prev` we need to feed into `reverse_k_nodes` needs to be a sentinel node.
