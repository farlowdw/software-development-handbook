            right.next = left           # reverse the `right` pointer to point at the `left` node
            left.next = next_left       # point the `left` node to the preserved connection beyond the `right` node
            prev.next = right           # maintain pointer connections to ensure continuity after swap
            prev = left                 # move `prev` forward in preparation for next pair to be processed
            left = next_left            # move `left` forward in preparation for next pair to be processed

```

**Time:** $O(n)$. The entire list is processed in a linear fashion.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Memory consumed does not increase as input size scales.

<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

As with most linked list problems, this problem becomes much easier if we take a moment to *draw* what happens for a general pair swap (the orange arrows indicate changes to each node's `next` attribute):

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='800px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/linked-lists/f8.png').default} />
</div>

The solution above naturally presents itself from this figure.

It's worth reflecting on why `prev` is necessary in the solution above. Consider what would happen in the previous figure if `prev` were not present &#8212; what would happen after swapping `3` and `4`? The connections would get mangled &#8212; we'd have `4 -> 3` as desired, but without `prev` we'd end up having `1 -> 3` after the swap, which is not desired. We need to maintain the connections to ensure continuity is preserved after each swap is made, and this is easiest to do with a `prev` pointer, as above. 

That's the entire purpose of the `prev` pointer in the solution above &#8212; it's used to ensure proper connections are maintained after swaps.
