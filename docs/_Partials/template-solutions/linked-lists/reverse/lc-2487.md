```python
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        def reverse(node):
            prev = None
            curr = node
            while curr:
                curr.next, prev, curr = prev, curr, curr.next
            return prev
        
        rev_head = reverse(head)
        sentinel = ListNode(float('-inf'))
        sentinel.next = rev_head
        
        prev = sentinel
        curr = rev_head
        while curr:
            if prev.val > curr.val:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        
        return reverse(sentinel.next)
```

The issue at the beginning of the problem lies in how the pointers restrict how we can manage what happens with decreasing values. Reversing the linked list as a pre-processing step is an effective strategy here. Then we can simply adjust pointers as needed to ensure our linked list is weakly increasing. *Then* as a final step we return the reversal of *that* linked list.
