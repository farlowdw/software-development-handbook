```python
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        def reverse(node):
            prev = None
            curr = node
            while curr:
                next_node = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = next_node
            return prev
        
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        left = head
        right = reverse(slow)
        ans = 0
        
        while right:
            ans = max(ans, left.val + right.val)
            left = left.next
            right = right.next
            
        return ans
```

This is an excellent linked list problem where a reversal can make things more efficient. Find the middle of the linked list, then reverse the rest of the linked list, and then iterate back towards the middle from the head as well as from the end that was just reversed (i.e., the head of the newly reversed portion of the linked list).
