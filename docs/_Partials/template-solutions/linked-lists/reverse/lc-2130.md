```python
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        prev = None
        mid_node = slow
        while mid_node:
            next_node = mid_node.next
            mid_node.next = prev
            prev = mid_node
            mid_node = next_node
            
        ans = 0
        start = head
        while prev:
            ans = max(ans, start.val + prev.val)
            start = start.next
            prev = prev.next
        
        return ans
```

This is an excellent linked list problem where a reversal can make things more efficient. Find the middle of the linked list, then reverse the rest of the linked list, and then iterate back towards the middle from the head as well as from the end that was just reversed (i.e., the head of the newly reversed portion of the linked list).
