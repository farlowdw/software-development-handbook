**Time:** $O(n)$. We process the entire list in a linear fashion.

**Space:** $O(1)$. Memory consumed does not increase as the input size scales.

<ChipDivider>Extended discussion</ChipDivider> 

This is a fun one: Find the middle of the linked list, reverse the rest of the linked list, and then iterate back towards the middle from the head as well as from the end that was just reversed (i.e., the head of the newly reversed portion of the linked list), maintaining the maximum pairwise sum as you go. 

Small potential "gotcha": after the reversal, `slow` points to the *second* middle node of the linked list (since the total number of nodes is always even), which means it's a single node past what we need to iterate through on the left hand side. The last while loop condition needs to be `while right`; otherwise, if we used `while left`, then trying to access `right.val` would eventually throw an error because the reversed segment on the right would be exhausted while there's a single node left on the left side.
