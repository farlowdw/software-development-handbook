```python
class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        def reverse(node):
            prev = None
            curr = node
            while curr:
                curr.next, prev, curr = prev, curr, curr.next
            return prev
        
        rev_head = reverse(head)
        carried = 0
        
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = rev_head
        curr = sentinel.next
        while curr:
            doubled = carried + curr.val * 2
            new_val = doubled % 10
            carried = doubled // 10
            curr.val = new_val
            curr = curr.next
            
        doubled_head = reverse(sentinel.next)
        
        if carried:
            new_head = ListNode(carried)
            new_head.next = doubled_head
            return new_head
        else:
            return doubled_head
```

The basic idea above is to first reverse the list so we can more easily manage the updating of node values &#8212; values range from `0` through `9` which means the doubled values range from `0` through `18`, where the original value being `5` or more means having a doubled value in the range `10`-`18`, which requires *carrying*.

We perform the needed value updates and maintain the number being carried along the way. Once we're done, we reverse the new list. If `carried` is `0`, then we're done, but if `carried` is not `0`, then whatever `carried` is should become the first value in our new list.

The [editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/solution/) for this problem is great. Reversing twice as done above is not necessary even though it is sufficient. There's a really slick one-pointer approach that takes advantage of how "carrying" works in terms of whether or not we ever need to update a node's value.
