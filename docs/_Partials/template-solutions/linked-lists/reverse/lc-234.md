```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        def reverse(node):
            prev = None
            curr = node
            while curr:
                next_node = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = next_node
            return prev
        
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True
        
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
        left = head
        right = reverse(slow)
        
        while right:
            if left.val != right.val:
                return False
            left = left.next
            right = right.next
        
        return True
```

The solution above is likely the intended solution for this problem even though destroying the original linked list is not a very desirable side effect. It's also nice that we do not have to consider the length of the list when making the reversal. An odd-length list like `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1` means that once the reversal occurs we get `1 -> 2 -> 3` starting from the original head and `1 -> 2 -> 3` starting from the head of the reversed segment. An even-length list like `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1` means after the reversal we have `1 -> 2 -> 2` starting from the head of the original list and `1 -> 2` starting from the head of the reversed segment. This is why it's important that our last while loop uses the condition `while right` as opposed to `while left`.

If the side effect mentioned above is not allowed, then we can use the "reverse `k` nodes in-place" template to determine whether or not the list's values are palindromic and also restore the list itself (although the logic becomes a bit more complicated):

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        def reverse_k_nodes(prev, k):
            if not prev.next or k < 2:
                return prev.next
            
            rev_start = prev.next
            next_node = rev_start.next
            rev_end = rev_start
            
            count = 1
            while count <= k - 1 and next_node:
                rev_start.next = next_node.next
                next_node.next = prev.next
                prev.next = next_node
                next_node = rev_start.next
                count += 1
            
            return rev_end
        
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True
        
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev = sentinel
        slow = fast = head
        char_count = 1
        while fast and fast.next:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            char_count += 1
        
        middle = slow if fast else prev
        reverse_k_nodes(middle, char_count)
        right = middle.next
        
        left = head
        for _ in range(char_count - 1):
            if left.val != right.val:
                reverse_k_nodes(middle, char_count)
                return False
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        # this reversal optional since values are palindromic after the in-place reversal
        reverse_k_nodes(middle, char_count)
        return True
```
