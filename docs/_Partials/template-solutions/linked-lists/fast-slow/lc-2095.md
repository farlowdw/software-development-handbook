```python
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev = sentinel
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        prev.next = prev.next.next
        return sentinel.next
```

Since `slow` will point to the middle node after the while loop terminates above, what we really need is for the node prior to `slow` to skip it, effectively deleting it: `prev.next = prev.next.next`.
