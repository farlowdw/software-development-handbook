```python
def find_node(head, k):
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    for _ in range(k):
        fast = fast.next
        
    while fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
        
    return slow
```

The idea here is to first advance the `fast` pointer `k` units ahead of the `slow` pointer and then to move them at the same speed for each iteration, meaning they will always be `k` units apart. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end (i.e., it points to null), the `slow` pointer will still be `k` nodes behind the `fast` pointer, which is the desired result.

The following illustration, where `k = 3`, may help:

```a title="Start"
    k
1234567
s
f
```

```a title="Move fast pointer ahead by k = 3 units"
    k
1234567
s
   f
```

```a title="After first iteration"
    k
1234567
 s
    f
```

```a title="After second iteration"
    k
1234567
  s
     f
```

```a title="After third iteration"
    k
1234567
   s
      f
```

```a title="After fourth iteration"
    k
1234567
    s
       f
```
