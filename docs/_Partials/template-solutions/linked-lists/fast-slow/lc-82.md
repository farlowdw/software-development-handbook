import LC from '@site/src/components/LC';

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev = sentinel
        curr = head
        while curr and curr.next:
            if curr.val == curr.next.val:
                while curr and curr.next and curr.val == curr.next.val:
                        curr.next = curr.next.next
                curr = curr.next
                prev.next = curr
            else:
                prev = curr
                curr = curr.next
        
        return sentinel.next
```

This problem is obviously quite similar to <LC id='83' type='long' ></LC>, but the requirement to remove *all* numbers that have duplicates basically makes this a completely different problem. As always, it's amazing how helpful a drawing that solves a basic example can be:

<div align='center' className='centeredImageDiv'>
  <img width='800px' src={require('@site/static/img/templates/linked-lists/f10.png').default} />
</div>

The picture above illustrates how `prev` and `curr` need to be moved together in unison when there are not duplicates; however, if duplicates are encountered, then we can employ a strategy similar to that used in <LC id='83' type='' ></LC>, where we effectively "delete" duplicates as they are encountered by changing the `next` attribute for `curr`: `curr.next = curr.next.next`. The twist with this problem is that we want to retain *none* of the duplicate values once we've encountered a non-duplicate value. As the figure suggests, one way of achieving this is to move `curr` past the last duplicate, and *then* change the `next` attribute for `prev` to point to the updated, non-duplicate `curr` node. This effectively cuts out all duplicate values, and `prev` itself is only ever updated when non-duplicate values are adjacent.
