            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            if slow == fast:
                slow = head
                
                while slow != fast:
                    slow = slow.next
                    fast = fast.next

Determining whether or not a cycle *exists* is a pre-requisite for coming up with a solution for this problem. We can effectively tweak our solution to <LC id='141' type='long' ></LC> in order to come up with the solution above:

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            # highlight-success-start
            if slow == fast:
                return True
            # highlight-success-end
            
        return False
```

That is, as the highlighted lines above suggest, we need to *do something* once we actually have determined that we have a cycle. What should we do? The following image (from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5TcPmTl6ww)) may help:

</div>

This image shows how `X` units are traveled before the cycle starts. We'll assume we're moving in a counterclockwise direction once we've entered the cycle. We can't know for sure how many times `fast` might travel the full cycle of `Y + Z` units before `slow` enters the cycle. The important observation is that *eventually* there will come a revolution where `fast` starts at the beginning of the cycle and `slow` joins the cycle during this revolution. 

How many units does `fast` travel before it meets `slow`? Where exactly `fast` is when `slow` enters the cycle does not matter &#8212; the important point is that it must travel the full distance of `Z + Y + Z` before coming back around to meet `slow`. In total, then, `fast` travels a distance of `X + R(Z + Y) + (Z + Y + Z)`, where `R(Z + Y)` denotes that `fast` has traveled `R` full cycle lengths before it starts its last revolution before `slow` enters the cycle. Since `slow` travels a total distance of `X + Z`, we have the following useful equation (we discard `R(Z + Y)` during the second simplifying step due to its cyclical nature):

```
2(X + Z) = X + R(Z + Y) + (Z + Y + Z)

2X + 2Z = X + 2Z + Y

X = Y
```

What the above equation *means* in the context of this problem is that all we really need to do to actually return the node at which the cycle starts is reset one of the nodes to start at the `head` and then just move them together in unison until they meet again (at the beginning of the cycle). We can then return the desired node.
