```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        curr = head
        while curr and curr.next:
            if curr.val == curr.next.val:
                curr.next = curr.next.next
            else:
                curr = curr.next
                
        return head
```

If this is your first time doing pointer manipulation with linked lists, then this problem is probably not as easy as it first seems like it should be. The "fast-slow" pointer pattern here is actually somewhat obscured since we do not have explicit `fast` and `slow` pointers. The approach here is effectively the following: "If the *next* node value is the same as the *current* node value, then we're just going to skip the next node; however, if the node values are *different*, then we will continue forward by not altering what the current node points to and advance the current node to the next node."

The approach above is arguably the cleanest approach. If you explicitly use two points, say a `lead` pointer for leading the way and a `lag` pointer for lagging behind (fast and slow pointers, respectively), then the following is one possible solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        
        lead = head
        lag = head
        
        while lead:
            lead = lead.next
            if lead and lead.val != lag.val:
                lag.next = lead
                lag = lead
                
        lag.next = None
                
        return head
```

Above, we never actually move the `lag` pointer until `lead` encounters a *new* value. The logic is slightly more complicated than the previous solution. We have to be careful at the end to make the assignment `lag.next = None` because there may be duplicated values *at the end* of the linked list (not making this assignment would mean all duplicate values at the end are kept).
