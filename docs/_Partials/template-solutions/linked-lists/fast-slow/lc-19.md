```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        sentinel = ListNode(-1)
        sentinel.next = head
        prev = sentinel
        slow = fast = head
        
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
            
        while fast:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
            
        prev.next = prev.next.next
        return sentinel.next
```

The idea: advance `fast` $n$ nodes past `slow` so that there are always $n$ nodes between these pointers. When the while loop terminates, `slow` will be $n$ units behind `fast` or $n$ nodes from the end of the list, as desired. But we need to *delete* this node, hence the use of the `prev` pointer.
