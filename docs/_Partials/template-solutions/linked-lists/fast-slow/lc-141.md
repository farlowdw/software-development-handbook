```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            if slow == fast:
                return True
            
        return False
```

The solution above takes advantage of [Floyd's cycle-detection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare), which is quite overcomplicated on the Wikipedia link. The main outcome of the algorithm is that the `slow` and `fast` pointers above *must* be equal at some point if there is a cycle. But how do we know this to be true? Would it be possible for the `fast` pointer to "jump" the `slow` pointer in some way? How do we *know* they'll actually meet if there's a cycle?

The easiest way to answer this question is to break down all of the possibilities once `slow` and `fast` are both within the cycle; that is, `fast` will obviously be well ahead of `slow` *until* `slow` actually enters the cycle, at which point `slow` and `fast` will either be at the same node or `fast` will be behind `slow`. We have the following possibilities:

- **Case 1:** `fast` and `slow` meet exactly when `slow` enters the cycle (i.e., at the beginning of the cycle)
- **Case 2:** `fast` is exactly one node *behind* `slow`, and the two nodes will meet on the very next iteration since `slow` will move forward one node and `fast` will move forward two nodes
- **Case 3:** `fast` is exactly two nodes *behind* `slow`, and the nodes will meet after two more iterations since `slow` will have moved two more nodes and `fast` will have moved four more nodes
- **Case 4:** `fast` is more than two nodes *behind* `slow`, which means `fast` will eventually catch up to `slow` in such a way that this case resolves into either case 2 or case 3, which means the nodes will still meet

The important takeaway above is that `fast` will *never* jump `slow`. The two nodes must meet if there is a cycle.
