```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
        return slow
```

This uses the classic fast-slow technique. For odd numbers:

```a title="Start"
  x
12345
s
f
```

```a title="After first iteration"
  x
12345
 s
  f
```

```a title="After second iteration"
  x
12345
  s
    f
```

Done! And we're fortunate with even numbers since we're asked to return the *second* middle node:

```a title="Start"
   x
123456
s
f
```

```a title="After first iteration"
   x
123456
 s
  f
```

```a title="After second iteration"
   x
123456
  s
    f
```

```a title="After third iteration"
   x
123456
   s
      f
```

Things work out nicely in this case. What if, however, we were asked to return the *first* middle node? Then we could make use of a `prev` pointer to basically lag behind the `slow` pointer. Which node we returned at the end would depend on where `fast` was (not null for odd-length lists and null for even-length lists):

```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
        return prev if not fast else slow
```
