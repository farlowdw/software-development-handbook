## Description

Good for storing networks, geography, social relationships, etc. A graph organizes items in an interconnected network. Each item is a node (or vertex). Nodes are connected by edges:

</p>

</p>

**Strengths:**

- **Representing links:** Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with *things that connect to other things*. Nodes and edges could, for example, respectively represent cities and highways, routers and ethernet cables, or Facebook users and their friendships.

**Weaknesses:** 

- **Scaling challenges:** Most graph algorithms are $O(n\lg n)$ or even slower. Depending on the size of your graph, running algorithms across your nodes may not be feasible.

### Terminology

**Directed or undirected:** In **directed** graphs, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. In **undirected** graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

</p>

**Cyclic or acyclic:** A graph is **cyclic** if it has a cycleâ€”-an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are **acyclic**.

</p>

**Weighted or unweighted:** If a graph is **weighted**, each edge has a "weight." The weight could, for example, represent the distance between two locations, or the cost or time it takes to travel between the locations.

</p>

**Legal coloring:** A **graph coloring** is when you assign colors to each node in a graph. A **legal coloring** means no adjacent nodes have the same color:

### Representations

There are a few different ways to store graphs. Let's take this graph as an example:

</p>

#### Edge list

A list of all the edges in the graph:

``` JS
const graph = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]];
```

Since node `3` has edges to nodes `1` and `2`, `[1, 3]` and `[2, 3]` are in the edge list.

Sometimes it's helpful to pair our edge list with a list of all the *nodes*. For example, what if a node doesn't have any edges connected to it? It wouldn't show up in our edge list at all!

#### Adjacency list

A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node's neighbors:

``` JS
const graph = [
  [1],
  [0, 2, 3],
  [1, 3],
  [1, 2],
];
```

Since node `3` has edges to nodes `1` and `2`, `graph[3]` has the adjacency list `[1, 2]`.

We could also use an object where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of neighbors.

``` JS
const graph = {
  0: [1],
  1: [0, 2, 3],
  2: [1, 3],
  3: [1, 2],
};
```

This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn't map cleanly to array indices.

#### Adjacency matrix

A matrix of `0`s and `1`s indicating whether node `x` connects to node `y` (`0` means no, `1` means yes).

``` JS
const graph = [
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 1, 0],
];
```

Since node `3` has edges to nodes `1` and `2`, `graph[3][1]` and `graph[3][2]` have value `1`.

### Algorithms

#### BFS and DFS

You should know breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) down pat so you can code them up quickly. Lots of graph problems can be solved using just these traversals:

- **Is there a path between two nodes in this undirected graph?** Run DFS or BFS from one node and see if you reach the other one.
- **What's the shortest path between two nodes in this undirected, unweighted graph?** Run BFS from one node and backtrack once you reach the second. Note: BFS always finds the shortest path, assuming the graph is undirected and unweighted. DFS does not always find the shortest path.
- **Can this undirected graph be colored with two colors?** Run BFS, assigning colors as nodes are visited. Abort if we ever try to assign a node a color different from the one it was assigned earlier.
- **Does this undirected graph have a cycle?** Run BFS, keeping track of the number of times we're visiting each node. If we ever visit a node twice, then we have a cycle.

#### Advanced graph algorithms

If you have lots of time before your interview, these advanced graph algorithms pop up occasionally:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a *weighted* graph.
- **Topological Sort:** Arranges the nodes in a *directed, acyclic* graph in a special order based on incoming edges.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree:** Finds the cheapest set of edges needed to reach all nodes in a *weighted* graph.
