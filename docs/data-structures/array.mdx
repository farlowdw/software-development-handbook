## Static Array

### Description

Stores things in order. Has quick lookups by index. An array organizes items sequentially, one after another in memory. Each position in the array has an index, starting at 0.

### Strengths

#### Fast lookups

Retrieving the element at a given index takes $O(1)$ time, regardless of the length of the array.

#### Fast appends

Adding a new element at the end of the array takes $O(1)$ time (i.e., if the array has space).

### Weaknesses

#### Fixed size

You need to specify how many elements you're going to store in your array ahead of time. (Unless you're using a dynamic array.)

#### Inserts and deletes

You have to "scoot over" the other elements to fill in or close gaps, which takes worst-case $O(n)$ time (i.e., inserts and deletes can be costly).
